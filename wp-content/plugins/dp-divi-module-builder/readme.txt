This plugin is maintained and updated to work with the latest version of the Divi theme to the best of our ability.
We have no control over Divi theme updates. For that reason, installation of any Divi updates should be made on a test
server before being made to a live site. This is good practice for any theme/plugin. If a conflict is found with our
plugin and the Divi theme, we will work to resolve the issue and release an update as soon as possible.

ACTIVATION
The Divi Module Builder Module plugin has two license types: single site and unlimited site. If you purchased a single site
license, the plugin can only be activated on one site at any time. If you purchased an unlimited license, the plugin
will activate on unlimited sites.

To activate the plugin, go to the Settings page in the Dashboard and click on DMB Activation. There you will see an
Activation tab and Deactivation tab. To activate, enter the activation key found in your account dashboard under the
Divi Module Builder Keys link:
https://www.diviplugins.com/my-account/

To deactivate the plugin and activate on another site (single site license), click on the deactivation tab in the
instructions above.

PHP LOCKOUT
In the likely event you lock yourself out of a module due to improper PHP markup (we locked ourselves out many times.
It's going to happen), you can easily recover by disabling PHP for that module. To do this, go to the plugin's Settings page
under Custom Modules in the Dashboard. Click on the Disable PHP button for the module you are locked out of. Edit the
module and fix your mistake. Then you can turn PHP back on from within the module or back on the Settings page.

CLONING MODULES
You can easily duplicate a module from the Settings page under Custom Modules in the Dashboard. Click on the Clone
button for the module you want to copy. Your cloned module will get copied to the Draft Modules. From their you can click
on the Edit button, change the title, make changes, and publish the module.

PUBLISHED VS DRAFT MODULES
Only published modules will become available in the Divi Builder.

EXPORTING AND IMPORTING MODULES
You can easily export and import modules from the Settings page under Custom Modules in the Dashboard. Exporting a
module will save it to your default download folder set in your browser settings and will save as a json file. You can
import a module from the same settings page. The imported module must be in json format.
