&lt;p&gt;Applause, the world leader in testing and digital quality, today announced its expanded capabilities in assisting clients with the training, testing and validation of high-quality generative AI models. Applause has been empowering global organizations to deliver advanced and reliable AI-driven solutions for many years, and is now at the forefront of helping companies test their large-scale generative AI platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause offers comprehensive services designed to evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI models. By subjecting these algorithms to rigorous testing, Applause helps clients identify areas for improvement, enhance model performance, and ensure reliable and unbiased outputs. The testing process encompasses real-world scenarios and diverse user interactions, providing valuable insights into the algorithm&#039;s capabilities and limitations. The testing scopes are customized to each model&#039;s needs, including reviews of functional capabilities, accuracy of responses, checks for bias/inappropriate content, adherence to custom guidelines, and user experience feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause’s second annual AI and Voice Applications Survey, released in March of 2023, looked at sentiment around AI-powered chatbots and smart voice assistants. When questioned about generative AI technology like ChatGPT, an overwhelming 86% of over 5,000 survey respondents expressed concern over using the technology due to potential bias of its responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce bias, Applause provides an enhanced, proven global data collection infrastructure that allows clients to gather diverse and comprehensive datasets for training their LLMs and generative AI models. By leveraging the collective intelligence of a global community of expert testers, Applause ensures the collection of high-quality data covers a wide range of scenarios, use cases and languages. This robust dataset serves as a valuable resource for clients looking to improve the accuracy, performance and overall user experience of their AI algorithms. Applause&#039;s data collection and testing services are seamlessly integrated into its crowdtesting platform, allowing clients to easily leverage these capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For more than a decade, Applause has partnered with the world’s leading brands to help them deliver the most innovative digital experiences that exceed their customers’ expectations. Our unparalleled experience in training and validating, as well as our established AI/LLM best practices, will continue to enable industry thought leaders to unlock the full potential of generative AI technologies, while helping to improve the integrity and quality of these experiences. Leveraging our testing community, we can provide valuable, nuanced human insights that help algorithms learn and as a result, improve their accuracy,” said Rob Mason, CTO of Applause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause’s unique model helps to combat the three main risks and challenges in deploying AI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accuracy and Trust: confirming responses, calling out “hallucinations” or factual inaccuracies, and understanding user experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bias and Inappropriate Content: ensuring datasets are broad enough to rule out systemic bias (racial, gender, religious), and do not contain inappropriate or harmful content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ethical and Regulatory Compliance: checking that models are compliant with copyright, IP permissions or government regulations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As the prevalence of AI technology continues to shape the business landscape, it becomes crucial for companies to possess comprehensive and unbiased data and test their applications with real people. Applause’s global community of over 1.7 million testers has been successfully supporting this capability at scale, offering leading enterprises the necessary training, testing, validation, and user feedback to drive continuous improvement in this rapidly evolving field,&quot; said Chris Malone, CEO of Applause. &quot;With the advent of generative AI, we are witnessing an unprecedented expansion of our overall digital quality testing strategy, empowering enterprises to realize significant benefits and reduced risks as they roll out new AI solutions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<div class='progress-msg'>[22:31:03] - Custom field `_et_pb_old_content` will be updated with value `Second annual report on more than 200,000 digital quality defects spanning all key industries, offers guidance and frameworks for improvement

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Functional, visual, and content defects make up more than 90% of all bugs found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a second year, 65% of accessibility bugs identified were screen reader errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;80% of all payment bugs were “functional,” indicating that some part of the transaction couldn’t be completed as intended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Missing or poor translations accounted for 73% of the localization errors – increasing over 8% from the previous year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause, a world leader in testing and digital quality, today released its second annual &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:969468@1:url||https://www.applause.com/state-of-digital-quality-2023/global}&quot;&gt;State of Digital Quality&lt;/a&gt; report, a comprehensive examination of real-world testing data which identifies the most common flaws in digital experiences – digital banking, streaming media services, wearable devices, online shopping, voice-activated device usage, and more – and provides pathways for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The extensive report examines key aspects of digital quality, including accessibility, localization, and payments – areas which can greatly affect customer satisfaction and product usability. The report notes that failing to address flaws and friction points along the customer journey often results in costly problems like shopping cart abandonment, missed conversions, customer service complaints, poor customer satisfaction and negative ratings, all which affect a company’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“It’s interesting that in the second year of the report, we continue to observe companies challenged by the same types of defects and digital quality issues – especially pertaining to accessibility and localization. This is why testing all code – new and existing – for all digital customer journeys is so crucial. It only takes one defect to have a negative customer experience that impacts revenue,” said Luke Damian, Chief Growth Officer for Applause. “As new technologies and innovations continue to evolve, companies need to commit to getting it right the first time to remain competitive. That requires continued quality testing – from design through development, release and beyond,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This year’s report introduces digital quality frameworks that outline core capabilities and typical processes for organizations at different stages on the journey to excellence. The frameworks provide concrete guidance on how organizations can improve quality and efficiency across the organization. The report recommends several best practices for accelerating development, maturing testing organizations, and increasing digital quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in consistent and comprehensive testing to ensure digital quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Digital quality is an intersectional discipline. Functionality, localization, accessibility, payments, customer experience and UX bleed into one another. Testing must assess different components of an app or digital experience holistically, not just in isolation, to truly understand how customers engage with your brand. Companies that produce the most popular and highest-ranking apps across all categories invest in comprehensive functional testing to eliminate defects before they reach customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make customer journey and UX top priorities&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ensuring a customer journey is frictionless and accessible across all touchpoints and payment methods can be complicated and challenging. Industry leaders are increasingly looking at UX and customer journeys to understand how they create differentiated experiences and engage customers for the long-term. Testing the customer journey with real people in real situations is key to understanding how digital experiences will fare with actual customers. And, moving from accessibility testing to inclusive design actually creates a better user experience for all customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test using a wide variety of devices and network combinations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Because apps and websites often work differently across devices, networks, locations and operating systems, it is essential to test as many variations and real-world combinations of a digital property as possible. More traditional methods - like in-house or lab testing, often lack the resources to test these combinations effectively. Crowdtesting offers the flexibility, speed and resources to adequately test across thousands of variables, with the profiles and usage of actual customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commit to a testing strategy, not just testing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While testing is crucial for uncovering defects, a solid testing strategy is essential for growth. Organizations that dedicate time to documenting test cases and test run results, test case management, and quality management create repeatable processes that can scale. Achieving excellence doesn’t mean the work is done. Ideally, as QA practices improve, testing can shift left and become more automated, earlier in the development cycle, when issues are easier and less expensive to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The State of Digital Quality report is created from a representative sample from the company’s testing data spanning 70 industries and 159 countries, collected between January 1 and December 31, 2022. Testing involved nearly 3,500 payment sources and methods, 2,300 mobile device models, 2,200 smart TVs, and thousands of device/OS/browser combinations. Digital assets tested included websites, apps, IoT devices, mobile web and mobile apps in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Over the coming weeks, Applause will release additional State of Digital Quality reports focused on key industry vertical segments, including retail, media and telecommunications, finance, travel and hospitality, health and wellness, and B2B software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In today&#039;s digital landscape, delivering exceptional experiences is paramount.

She holds an MBA in Marketing and Media Management from Columbia Business School and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause, the world leader in testing and digital quality, today announced the results of its annual Accessibility and Inclusive Design Survey. The recently completed survey of more than 1,300 software testers, product engineers, legal professionals, software developers, QA and UX professionals across the globe, examines how companies prioritize accessibility when developing their digital experiences and how respondents rate their knowledge level regarding accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The study also asked respondents to rate their organizations’ levels of conformance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, a set of international standards for making web and mobile content more accessible to people with disabilities (PwD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;More than 68% of respondents said that digital accessibility is a higher priority for their organizations than it was last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nearly 43% of respondents rated digital accessibility as a &lt;em&gt;top priority&lt;/em&gt; for their organizations, which is down slightly from 46% in 2022; 37% rated accessibility as &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt;. Fewer than 7% rated accessibility as either a &lt;em&gt;low priority&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;not at all&lt;/em&gt; important to their organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Despite the tendency for more organizations to prioritize accessibility than not, the survey shows that just over one-third are conforming to WCAG 2.1 (up from 30% in 2022). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Regarding their personal level of understanding of digital accessibility, more than one-third of respondents rated their knowledge level as either &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; (28%) or &lt;em&gt;very little&lt;/em&gt; (7.5%). Under 6% consider themselves experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just less than one-fourth of the engineers who participated in the survey said they &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;write code with accessibility in mind, which, though a small group, is a considerable increase from 15% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;More than 29% of product developers surveyed said they &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; build accessibility into their design plans at the earliest stages (up from 27% in 2022 and 24% in 2021).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“With the pending update to WCAG standards this summer, and the implementation of the EU Accessibility Act in June 2025, companies need to commit to advancing their focus on accessibility and inclusivity for their digital products and experiences. Making strides in accessibility often requires education and a cultural shift within organizations. If there is a disconnect between prioritizing accessibility and actually taking the steps necessary to make it a reality, it’s difficult to make progress,&quot; said Bob Farrell, Vice President of Solution Delivery and CX Practices for Applause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&quot;The survey shows we haven’t really seen a huge amount of progress over the past three years, and there is even a growing trend for product developers to be less likely to build accessibility into their design plans. Digital accessibility requires an ongoing commitment to building inclusive experiences, designing products and writing code with accessibility in mind, and then testing digital properties for accessibility throughout the development process,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivators for Conformance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For a second year, respondents answered that the top three biggest motivators in achieving accessibility conformance were “improving usability for all end users” (45%), “building positive public perception” (22%) and “gaining and maintaining market share” (15%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Most organizations see the importance and value in releasing accessible products and experiences, but legal compliance is just a starting place. Truly accessible experiences require input from people with disabilities and non-disabled, both from a design and a testing angle. This is where organizations should engage the support of specialists where they need help, to ensure they are building fully accessible digital experiences for all,” Farrell said.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class='progress-msg'>[22:31:07] - Custom field `_et_pb_old_content` will be updated with value `Nearly one-third dissatisfied with chatbots overall, impacting customer satisfaction

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A study by Applause, a world leader in testing and digital quality, reveals that nearly one-third (30%) of users of chatbots, interactive voice response (IVR) services and conversational assistants are dissatisfied with their experiences. In addition, the study has revealed concerns about inherent bias that can negatively influence engagements and outcomes with AI-driven voice applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The results are drawn from Applause’s second annual AI and Voice Applications Survey to gain insights into AI user experiences. Conducted in February and March of 2023, the survey collected responses from nearly 5,200 digital quality testing professionals from around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;ChatGPT is proving to be popular among users, with 74% responding positively about their experience with the recently released generative AI application. When asked if ChatGPT had understood their questions and provided them with helpful answers, more than two-thirds (67%) responded with “yes”. When asked whether ChatGPT or similar technology would help them to complete their work-related tasks, the vast majority responded that it would be “very” (43%) or “somewhat” (37%) helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Conversely, when asked about interactions with chatbots in general, up to 30% said they were dissatisfied with the experience - referring to wrong answers (29%) and a lack of understanding (24%) as reasons for dissatisfaction. Respondents were also frustrated by the failure of chatbots to appreciate language variations or the phrasing of questions. However, one-third indicated that they would use chatbots more if they responded more accurately to questions and voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Despite these complaints, 92% of respondents expect companies to have chatbots on their apps or websites, eliminating the need for a call. A similar number (86%) said they expect to be greeted by an IVR system when they call a business. Nearly half of respondents (44%) expect mobile apps to have voice assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The study also looked at sentiment around the inherent biases that can affect interactions with AI powered chatbots and smart voice assistants. Bias occurs when the underlying algorithm has been trained with poor and limited data. This impacts its decision making and leads to negative or unanticipated experiences. When questioned about bias in generative AI technology like ChatGPT, an overwhelming 86% of survey respondents expressed their concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“As AI technology becomes ubiquitous and we rely on it more heavily for mission-critical business functions, it is essential that we focus on quality – both from a data collection standpoint, and from a training and testing perspective. For a second year in-a-row, a vast number of survey respondents shared their frustration with current chatbot interactions. Organizations must focus on bringing real world, unbiased insights into their development processes to drive improvements to their AI experiences and meet their customers’ rising expectations,” said Luke Damian, Chief Growth Officer for Applause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The AI and Voice Applications Survey is the first of a series of digital quality surveys Applause will conduct this year. In May 2023, the company plans to release its second annual&lt;a href=&quot;{entry:839965@1:url||https://www.applause.com/state-of-digital-quality-2022}&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;State of Digital Quality Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which analyzes a representative sample of its testing data and reports on the most common flaws in digital experiences in several industries including retail, finance, media and telecommunications, and travel and hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;a world leader in testing and digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that 2022 was another record-breaking year for growth and expansion, with even more global brands selecting Applause as their partner for testing digital experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause exited 2022 with a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 60, marking the tenth quarter in a row of NPS scores well above 50. This continued strong performance demonstrates that Applause remains the premier partner that brands such as Fanatics can turn to for authentic, real-world feedback on the quality of their digital experiences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a truly exciting time for Fanatics Betting and Gaming as we gear up to launch our online sports betting platform later this year. We are committed to providing a seamless, user-centric sportsbook experience that our customers will love. To help with our efforts, we’ve engaged Applause for their expertise and knowledge around digital quality testing, including sports betting products. Their testers give us insights into how real users in real situations will interact with and use our app, and then using those learnings, we can offer our customers the best sportsbook experience possible,” said Ian Botts, Chief Technology Officer, Fanatics Betting and Gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“2022 was another year of exceeding customer expectations, and I could not be prouder of the Applause team’s achievements. In a complex world of market volatility, new technology eclipsing the old, fluid buying channels and changing expectations, digital remains the constant. Our continued growth and high NPS show that we are helping our customers rise to the occasion, and I want to thank them for their continued trust and partnership,” said Chris Malone, Applause’s Chief Executive Officer. “I am also very proud of our strong results – which clearly reflect our leadership in the testing space, as well as strong demand despite economic uncertainty. Applause is the release partner of choice for all things digital, and we will continue to help our customers release faster, with confidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Applause saw continued strong demand for its core Functional Testing solution, as well as substantial growth in its Voice/AI, Payments, Usability and Accessibility solutions, as global demand for digital quality testing continues to accelerate. While the company works with leaders in virtually every industry vertical, Applause saw particularly strong growth in the high tech, financial services and media segments, where brands are responding to rapidly changing digital requirements from their customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause’s commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction was acknowledged in 2022 with many global industry awards including: a Stevie People’s Choice Award for Favorite Software Company for a second year in a row; silver awards for Company of the Year from both the Best in Biz International Awards and the American Business Awards programs; an APPEALIE SaaS Award in the Development and DevOps category; a bronze ranking for Software Company of the Year in the Stevie International Business Awards program; a North American Software Testing Leading Vendor Award; and an AI Excellence Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause has also been named to the &lt;em&gt;Software Development Times&lt;/em&gt; 2022 Top 100 Best in Show list for the third year in a row, and for a fourth time has been recognized for its corporate culture by &lt;em&gt;Boston Business Journal&lt;/em&gt; on the 2022 Best Places to Work list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause, a world leader in testing and digital quality, today announced the 2022 results of its third annual global survey on holiday shopping trends. The research showed a marked increase in consumers returning to physical store locations. Eighty two percent of consumers said they were comfortable shopping in-store, compared to less than half (46%) in 2020 and 69% in 2021. More than one third (35%) of respondents also said they were planning to spend less on holiday shopping this year than in 2021, likely due to volatile economic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The survey took place in October 2022 with more than 4,750 respondents from across the Americas, EMEA and APAC. Additional key findings include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plans for online shopping decrease slightly, but the option continues to reign.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ecommerce exploded at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2021, 91% of consumers said they planned to shop online. That number slightly decreased to 87% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When asked at what point in the online shopping experience they would most likely abandon an online purchase, 29% responded they would abandon the purchase if they encountered bugs at any point of the shopping experience, while 34% said during the checkout process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There have been significant behavior shifts in the way people shop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Omnichannel shopping options like curbside pick up, BOPIS (buy online, pick up in-store) and BORIS (buy online, return in-store) continue to gain popularity. Globally, 70% of respondents said they have used BOPIS options for holiday shopping compared to 58% in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Regarding preferred digital shopping methods, 61% said they prefer using a mobile device, 37% prefer desktop or laptop, and 2% prefer to use voice activated smart devices for online shopping. This represents a significant change from 2020 where 53% said they prefer to do their online shopping via laptop or computer with the remaining 47% opting for a smartphone or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred payment methods vary by region. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Globally, credit card (35%) is the preferred payment method, followed by debit card (32%), mobile wallet (16%, increased from 14.2% in 2021), and cash (13%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the Americas, credit card (56%) payments are more highly preferred than the overall global response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What matters to online shoppers is changing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Sixty two percent of respondents said that making purchases with a trusted brand is more important to their online shopping experience than price (32%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;However, for the first time in 2022, respondents said product reviews were the most important decision-making factor at 34.8% compared to 24% in 2021, and 22% in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Retail has become an even more competitive and complex industry as a result of COVID, with shoppers interacting with brands across multiple touchpoints and demanding seamless, unique experiences,” said Luke Damian, chief growth officer with Applause. “The holiday shopping data we’ve collected from the past three years shows how that landscape continues to evolve and how poor user experiences and negative product reviews can impact customers&#039; decisions to purchase from and remain loyal to a brand. More and more, we see that prioritizing quality and delivering great digital experiences for all shoppers is essential to brand success.”&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Global Survey Finds More Than One Third Of Consumers Plan To Spend Less This Holiday Season, Even As They Return to Retail Stores` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, a world leader in testing and digital quality, today announced the launch of the first three inaugural episodes of its new podcast titled, &lt;em&gt;Ready, Test, Go. brought to you by Applause&lt;/em&gt;. Podcast host, David Carty, invites leading experts in the software industry, including technology executives, software engineers, user experience (UX) consultants and testers, to participate in lively discussions about their expertise, industry best practices and practical advice for creating high-quality digital experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each episode will focus on a specific industry or technology-related topic. Carty and his featured guests will examine challenges and opportunities faced by technology leaders, software engineers, product development teams, and quality assurance and testing professionals when developing digital experiences, and they will explore techniques and solutions for improving digital quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In episode 1, Testing in Two Days, Carty hosts software testing and quality assurance subject matter expert, Amy Reichert. Reichert, who has nearly two decades of testing experience, discusses how to make testing processes more efficient and comprehensive to help teams stay on target with tight release deadlines. She also examines characteristics that make testers more effective in their roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In episode 2, UX Metrics That Actually Make Sense, Carty dives into a discussion on building UX awareness, measuring UX effectiveness and developing better organizational buy-in, with UX and conversational artificial intelligence consultant and founder of outriderUX, Inge De Bleecker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For episode 3, Why So Ceremonious? Carty hosts Jeff Payne, CEO and founder of Agile and DevOps consulting firm, Coveros. Payne details the tenets of Agile product development and testing, and walks listeners through the steps development teams should take to create Agile workflows for maximized efficiency and improved quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re so excited to launch &lt;em&gt;Ready, Test, Go&lt;/em&gt;,” said Luke Damian, chief growth officer for Applause. “Our intention is to offer industry professionals a fun and interesting venue to gain digital quality insights and practical tips they can use in their everyday roles, from thought leaders in software development, user experience and quality testing. Obviously, Applause is passionate about digital quality, and we hope to share our enthusiasm for and commitment to quality through the podcast,” Damian said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause, a world leader in testing and digital quality, today announced the results of a recent survey examining the use and user satisfaction of travel and hospitality apps. More than 5,200 global respondents provided insights into overall satisfaction with the apps they use, to the most typical flaws and friction points they encounter, and whether apps have been useful in navigating travel challenges such as lost baggage, flight cancellations, delays or unexpected closures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;More than 90% of respondents had more than one travel or hospitality app on their phone, and 82% had traveled at least once during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top reasons for using apps&lt;/strong&gt;: to help plan accommodations (23%), make flight reservations (21%), purchase train, ferry or bus tickets (17%), rent a car or reserve car service (12%), to make entertainment purchases such as bike rentals or museum tickets (12%), and to make meal reservations (10%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When plans change, users are often disappointed&lt;/strong&gt;: 37% said apps have not been helpful in managing recent travel challenges (rebooking canceled flights, finding last minute accommodations). 20% noted that they were either “somewhat” or “very dissatisfied” with their overall app experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common bugs and friction points&lt;/strong&gt;: The most notable problems travelers encountered when using apps were inability to find the information they were looking for (18%), very slow app response times (13%), localization problems (12%), difficulty using payment sources (11%), or unfulfilled requests, like a preferred hotel room or seating option, not honored on-site (10%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When plans don’t change, much higher satisfaction&lt;/strong&gt;: 67% responded that they were somewhat or extremely satisfied with the apps they used for planning travel details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a time when a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/summer-travel-costs-airports-flying-driving-inflation-survey/&quot;&gt;majority of travelers are facing travel disruptions&lt;/a&gt;, delays and other issues, it’s so important that brands are focused on the quality of their digital experiences,” said Luke Damian, chief growth officer for Applause. “Ensuring that apps are tested by users in local markets especially helps eliminate design flaws and friction points that can heighten a traveler’s frustration. Providing travelers with helpful tools and high quality digital experiences can go a long way in protecting brand reputations and enhancing customer loyalty. It can be a differentiator in the market.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Applause released the &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:841866@1:url||https://www.applause.com/state-of-digital-quality-2022/travel}&quot;&gt;State of Digital Quality Report for Travel and Hospitality&lt;/a&gt;, which analyzed the company’s 2021 testing data across travel and hospitality organizations, and provided observations and recommendations for areas of quality improvement. In that report, workflow and functional errors accounted for 59.9% of travel app functional defects.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Travel Apps Leave 37{45d9d09bc4ff7471e9be5c3c1c680d706c9c07a872c2efd754f113cde0eb132e} of Users Unsatisfied When Facing Delays, Changes` ...</div>

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Marker Trax has enlisted the services of enterprise-grade testing and digital quality company Applause, to further refine its industry-defining digital casino marker technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Working with the experts at Applause, Marker Trax will receive the most technologically advanced quality assurance testing (QAT) metrics to further optimize its product, and will also benefit from Applause’s team of real-world testers who will report on all aspects of the Marker Trax experience, including providing video documentation of all enrollment attempts and real-time feedback to allow Marker Trax to benchmark user experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“We’ve redefined the digital payments sector at Marker Trax, and a key reason behind our success is that we consistently optimize and improve the technology,” said Marker Trax COO Charlie Skinner. “Working with Applause is a natural next step in our commitment to building a better product, inspiring greater operator confidence, and encouraging more player adoption.” Skinner added that the insights gained from the Applause testing reports will only aid in the company’s momentum as it expands throughout Nevada and the United States. &lt;/p&gt;

These teams provide authentic, real-world feedback to help companies understand how their customers will interact with their apps, devices and digital experiences, and improve quality whenever challenges are discovered. Testers also provide critical, aggregated insights that inform release decisions, helping development teams build better software and release it with confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause Chief Growth Officer, Luke Damian, says the company is excited to be working with Marker Trax to help the company further optimize their product. “For nearly 15 years, we’ve set the benchmark for digital quality testing, helping some of the largest, most influential companies in the world refine their technology based on the feedback and insights provided by our global community of testers.

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause, the world leader in testing and digital quality, today announced the 2022 results of its third consecutive, annual global survey on digital accessibility. The recently completed survey of nearly 1,800 respondents, examines how companies prioritize accessibility when developing their digital experiences, and what degree of emphasis they place on satisfying Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, a set of international standards for making web and mobile content more accessible to people with disabilities (PwD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;While many organizations recognize that neglecting accessibility (A11y) can result in legal risks and lost business opportunities, full digital accessibility has additional benefits beyond risk mitigation. Back-end coding that supports accessible design can boost search engine optimization, make automated testing easier, and generally improve the user experience for all potential customers, including PwD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nearly 46% of respondents rated digital accessibility as a top priority for their organizations; 34% rated accessibility as important. Fewer than 6% rated accessibility as either a low priority or not even on the organization’s radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;More than 68% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that digital accessibility is a higher priority for their organizations than it was last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Despite the tendency for organizations to prioritize accessibility as noted above, just over 30% said their organization’s website meets WCAG 2.1 standards. Of that group who said they meet standards, only 14% said they meet AAA, which is the highest level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When asked about common mistakes developers make from an accessibility perspective, the top answers were “error alerts are not descriptive” (14.5%), “site and page structure are unclear” (13.5%) and “lack of captions/transcripts on videos” (13.4%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;42% of respondents said they either have limited or no in-house expertise or resources to test for accessibility on an ongoing basis without external help. Nearly 29% said they have some expertise, but could use more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Organizations certainly need to comply with accessibility standards from a legal perspective. However, from a broader business perspective, it’s essential for organizations to focus on developing and releasing products that are accessible and inclusive to the greatest number of current and future users. To achieve that, accessibility testing should be ongoing, and conducted with input from people with disabilities, so organizations can understand how their products will perform in real-world scenarios,” said Luke Damian, chief growth officer for Applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivators for Conformance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Respondents answered that the top three biggest motivators in achieving accessibility conformance were “improving usability for all end users” (50.5%), “building positive public perception” (21%) and “gaining and maintaining market share” (12%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“As a best practice, companies should go beyond the minimum and prioritize inclusive design to create seamless experiences for all customers. Yet many organizations do not have the in-house expertise and resources they need. This is where organizations should engage the support of specialists to help ensure they are building high-quality, fully accessible digital experiences,” Damian said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Report covers functional, accessibility, localization, CX and payments testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brands rank finding crashes (75%) and functional bugs (61%) exceptionally valuable &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poor and missing translations account for 67% of localization issues, while screen readers comprise 66% of all accessibility bugs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause, the world leader in testing and digital quality, today released the &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:839965@1:url||https://www.applause.com/state-of-digital-quality-2022}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;State of Digital Quality&lt;/a&gt; report, the industry’s most comprehensive examination of real-world testing data to identify the most common flaws in digital experiences – everything from voice-activated devices and wearables to online shopping, digital banking and streaming media services – and map out how companies can prevent them from making their way into production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State of Digital Quality report examines how organizations are balancing their developers&#039; desire to release quickly with their customers’ demand for high quality experiences, sometimes with mixed results. The report makes clear that digital quality drives positive brand perception and impacts revenue. Bugs eat away at the foundation of product excellence, and every error, crash and flawed user experience diminishes customer delight, eventually eroding business’ bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause’s extensive report examines key aspects of digital quality, including accessibility and localization. The study revealed that screen readers comprise 66% of all accessibility bugs, compared to keyboard navigation issues and insufficient color contrast which combined make up about 20% of all accessibility bugs. Poor and missing translations account for 67% of localization-related bugs. Nearly half of brands (47%) saw problems with currency and number formatting as the most valuable bugs to identify when it came to localization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands value testing highly, as it eliminates bugs and dramatically reduces potential negative business impact after release. Overall, brands ranked the discovery of crashes (75%), functional bugs (61%) and lag and latency issues (53%) as exceptionally valuable. With 36% of users willing to abandon an app after a single use, and 63% willing to leave a brand due to poor customer experience, making sure digital assets and experiences work as intended is often the only difference between the winners and losers in digital quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The report highlights that digital quality is a business issue, not solely a technology problem. Brands that see digital quality as an opportunity for constant evolution, rather than a box to check with each release, win consistently. Organizations that invest in innovation, intuitive user experiences, and seamless customer journeys capture serious returns in a matter of months. These companies report increased market share, faster time to market, better customer retention and satisfaction, higher average sales, and a host of other benefits that tie back to revenue,” said Applause Chief Growth Officer, Luke Damian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create this report, Applause analyzed a representative sample of the company’s testing data to identify the most common flaws in digital experiences and map out how organizations can prevent them from making their way into production. This data set spanned January 1 to December 31, 2021, 159 countries, 70+ industries, multiple testing categories, more than 340,000 bugs, 13,000 mobile devices, 1,000 unique desktops and 500 OS versions. Digital assets tested included websites, apps, IoT devices, mobile web and mobile apps in real-world scenarios. Applause augmented this foundational data with insight from our digital and testing experts, gleaned while working with our customers to address their toughest digital quality challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the Leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations that are seeing the benefits of customer retention and satisfaction are those that have shifted left to embrace quality throughout the software development lifecycle. Rather than framing it as a final gate to pass through before release, these companies have made digital testing and quality an integrated part of the development process. These leaders have found that improving quality consistently pays off in cost savings, faster releases, and increased customer satisfaction and retention. This becomes even more important as a more complex generation of apps emerges to meet users’ expanding expectations of seamlessness and ease-of-use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Quality Best Practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report recommends some best practices to ensure digital quality and customer satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every digital experience requires comprehensive functional testing: &lt;/strong&gt;Functional testing is the backbone of digital quality — a crucial and ongoing effort in creating exceptional experiences. Companies that produce the most popular and highest-ranking apps across all categories invest in thorough functional testing. To spark loyalty and prevent customer churn, companies must make efforts to eliminate defects before they reach end users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility is more than a legal checkbox: &lt;/strong&gt;While many organizations recognize that neglecting accessibility (A11y) can put the business at risk legally, full digital accessibility has many benefits beyond risk mitigation. For example, voice functionality that serves people with limited mobility may also prove valuable for a user with their hands full, while closed captions on a video may be helpful for viewers learning to read as well as for the hearing-impaired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localization goes beyond translation: &lt;/strong&gt;Done properly, localization offers businesses tremendous potential to connect with new markets and grow. A poorly localized experience, however, can cost a business its reputation. As brands expand to new markets, it’s key for products to reflect the local language and social norms to build credibility. Digital experiences that demonstrate cultural sensitivity and attention to local preferences allow brands to foster trust and speed customer adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer journeys must track seamlessly across devices and locations:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite developers’ best efforts, apps and websites don’t always behave consistently across devices, networks, and operating systems. Small variations in the way different devices, OSes and browsers work can add up to big differences in performance and functionality, so it’s critical to test across customers&#039; devices of choice. As different types of experiences and transactions draw on an increasing number of digital touchpoints, the right coverage becomes a critical variable in testing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing with real, live payment instruments is key to ensure every customer can transact successfully&lt;/strong&gt;: The availability of a variety of payment methods, digital wallets, cryptocurrency, and trends like buy now, pay later (BNPL) make payment transactions more complex than ever. To ensure that payment experiences are working smoothly and seamlessly across a variety of scenarios, real-world testing with real people is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, Applause intends to release additional reports focused on the State of Digital Quality for key industry vertical segments, including retail, media &amp; telecommunications, finance, travel &amp; hospitality, health &amp; fitness and B2B software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause, the world leader in testing and digital quality, recently conducted a survey with 6,680 respondents about their experiences using artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of voice applications such as chatbots, interactive voice response (IVR), and other conversational assistants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Conducted in February 2022, the survey showed alignment between the expectations and experiences of participants in the U.S. and across Europe. According to the survey, consumers expect apps and websites to provide AI-driven customer service solutions, but they are not always satisfied with the user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For example, 93% of respondents expect chat functionality on a website, but only two-thirds said they were somewhat satisfied or extremely satisfied with the experience. More than half of respondents in the U.S. (51%) and Europe (57%) said they preferred to wait for a human agent when calling a company for customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The fact that more than half of respondents preferred to wait for a human agent instead of using a chatbot, IVR, or voice assistant speaks to a potential lack of confidence which perhaps is based on previous experiences. When a user has a bad digital experience, it is difficult to change that perception. This is a moment when quality can be a real differentiator, separating a brand from its competition. If customers expect these solutions to disappoint, they are predisposed to anticipate failure and quickly lose patience with any alternative that isn&#039;t a human interaction. Therefore, there is tremendous advantage to those who are able to deliver better experiences that can exceed the service level they have been conditioned to expect,” said Luke Damian, Chief Growth Officer, for Applause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Experience Trails Expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;93% expect chat functionality on a company’s website or app but only 63% said they were somewhat satisfied or extremely satisfied with the experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;89% expect call centers to have IVR systems that greet them but only 25% prefer immediate access to automated touchtone response systems, and 22% prefer an automated virtual service representative that responds to voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;44% always expect mobile apps to have voice assistants or voice search features while 41% said it depends on the app category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single AI application can require tens of thousands or more accurate and relevant data artifacts, all of which need to be collected with the application’s specific purpose and needs in mind. Applause leverages a community of more than one million qualified testers worldwide to collect the volume and quality of real world data needed to train and validate AI algorithms, like those used for IVR or chatbots, and then test the trained systems to ensure they are working as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Bias is a well-known challenge in AI. Algorithms that are not provided enough data or learn from data that is collected from a group of people that is too homogenous, can produce overly-generalized, biased outcomes and unintended behaviors. The size and breadth of the Applause community enables a diversity of feedback and input representing a wide variety of devices, plus limitless diversity of demographic and psychographic characteristics, including countries of origin or residence, ages, genders, cultures, abilities, languages, socioeconomic variables, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, the world leader in testing and digital quality, today announced that The Business Intelligence Group has named Emerson Sklar a winner in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bintelligence.com/artificial-intelligence-excellence-awards&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence Excellence Awards program&lt;/a&gt;. This business awards program recognizes organizations, products and people who bring Artificial Intelligence (AI) to life and apply it to solve real-world problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerson Sklar is the senior director of AI/ML at Applause. With over a decade of experience designing, delivering, and optimizing high-quality, robust solutions to challenging customer problems, Emerson has helped countless companies improve quality across every phase of the software development lifecycle through a human-centric, community-driven approach to testing. Emerson previously worked for Borland, the Army Intelligence and Securities Command, and the Army Research Lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause helps brands build, train, test and deliver AI solutions that delight their customers, drive measurable value, and establish themselves as industry leaders. Emerson has been instrumental in helping Applause provide a scalable end-to-end solution that both trains algorithms to learn quickly and tests the output to ensure those algorithms are processing and responding appropriately. Applause leverages a vetted global community of digital testers to deliver the widest possible range of training inputs, and then test the results across every possible device, location, and circumstance to identify issues and provide actionable user feedback in real-time. This enables brands to design, deliver, and maintain top quality AI experiences for all their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m honored to be among the incredible cohort of recipients of the 2022 Artificial Intelligence Excellence Award,” Emerson said. “Since beginning my career, I’ve held the strong belief that the end user experience is the most critical component of any technical solution. AI presents an opportunity to make a revolutionary impact on every individual, and what I’ve learned from our work with countless organizations is that to realize that potential, successful AI solutions absolutely need the human touch. With our global community, extensive experience, and specialized approach to real-world AI training and testing, Applause is uniquely positioned at the forefront of the AI space. I’m excited to be a part of what the future holds for AI and for the chance to help improve and ensure the quality of AI experiences used by hundreds of millions of individuals across the globe.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are so proud to name Emerson Sklar as a winner in our inaugural Artificial Intelligence Excellence Awards program”, said Maria Jimenez, chief nominations officer for Business Intelligence Group. “It was clear to our judges that Emerson was using AI to improve the lives of their customers and employees. Congratulations to the entire team!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, the world leader in testing and digital quality, recently surveyed more than 4,200 members of their uTest community, the largest community of testers in the world, about their experiences signing up for new digital services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the survey conducted in January 2022 show that the vast majority of users will decide to leave a digital service based on only one less-than-ideal experience and nearly two-thirds will leave because of a poorly constructed sign-up experience. With digital interactions front and center for brands, success depends on designing experiences around new customers&#039; high expectations and low patience during this critical touchpoint. Three industries (financial services, retail, and media and entertainment) represented more than half of all new digital service accounts opened in the previous thirty days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Customers have ever-shrinking limits to their digital patience,” said Applause Chief Growth Officer, Luke Damian. “This raises the stakes that every brand must exceed in delivering engaging digital quality. Every customer journey is unique which makes testing each customer experience increasingly more complicated. There are so many different friction points along a journey that combine the physical and digital world. If you don’t get it right, you can not only hurt the customer experience, but also do even greater long-term damage to the brand and the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survey results of 4,298 respondents from more than 200 countries include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;64% had created two or more new digital service accounts in the previous month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;65% abandoned a digital service because the sign-up process was too difficult&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;55% reported experiencing a digital process that took too long or had too many steps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;32% said they experienced a digital process that was unclear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey also highlighted that the numbers would have been even worse. When asked why they didn’t abandon the process, participants typically reported that the account was required (such as those for employment, schools, etc.) or they could not get the same product or service elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active in more than 200 countries, the Applause community of vetted digital testers empowers brands to capture and keep more customers by delivering authentic, real-world feedback on the state of their digital quality.

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the world leader in testing and digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that 2021 was another record-breaking year for growth and expansion, as the company surpassed $150 million in annualized recurring revenue. As part of Applause’s strategy to continuously enhance the value of its platform, the company also delivered two new offerings designed to accelerate development velocity and release frequency: Applause In-Sprint Testing, which allows testing earlier and faster with smaller chunks of code, and Applause Codeless Automation, which enables the creation of test scripts without writing a single line of code. Applause exited the year with a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 61.7, which is double the average for B2B software and SaaS brands, according to customer experience management firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/&quot;&gt;Relently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strong performance reinforces that Applause is the premier partner companies can turn to for authentic, real-world feedback on the quality of their digital experiences – the most important touchpoint for a brand today, as most of their customers will leave based on only one bad digital interaction. Applause’s disruptive approach to testing and quality harnesses the power of the company’s enterprise-class platform and leverages a vetted community of more than one million digital experts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause’s distributed community can test and assess from the perspective of a brand’s targeted customers – in every possible condition, including country, local language and device configuration, as well as through the lens of demographic and psychographic data points. No other company can provide such a rich trove of mission-critical, actionable insight and learning, to ensure that a brand’s digital assets perform to their customers’ expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I could not be prouder of the Applause team and what they achieved in 2021. I also want to thank our customers – who continue to partner with us year after year, and trust us to enable their digital quality, a critical aspect of business today. Our industry-leading NPS shows how we continue to deliver for those brands – helping them build better software and release it faster, with confidence,” said Chris Malone, Applause’s Chief Executive Officer. “I also could not be prouder of our 2021 results, which demonstrate that our differentiated approach to testing and digital quality is unequaled. Our innovative model surpasses traditional testing methods – like lab-grown and offshoring – which fail to keep pace with the requirements of digital-focused brands. Truly, Applause alone can deliver with the speed, scale and flexibility that brands expect today – and in 2022, we look forward to exceeding customer expectations again.&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of the testing and digital quality market acceleration and growth opportunities, Applause expanded its C-Suite through the addition and promotion of the following executives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christopher Jolie, CFO.&lt;/strong&gt; The company named Christopher Jolie as its new Chief Financial Officer, a role formerly held by its CEO, Chris Malone. As CFO, Chris is focused on delivering business oversight, financial planning and analysis, and process improvement to drive improved business performance and profitability across Applause. Prior to Applause, Chris spent 17 years at NTT DATA Services, where he held several high-profile financial roles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Bonos, COO and CRO.&lt;/strong&gt; The company expanded Tom Bonos’ responsibilities as Chief Revenue Officer to also include the role of Chief Operating Officer. As CRO, Tom is responsible for the vision and execution of Applause’s global worldwide Sales strategy. In his expanded role as COO, Tom will also be responsible for the Customer Operations team, unifying the company’s sales and delivery strategies to drive more value and further customer success. Prior to Applause, Tom held senior sales leadership positions at ServiceSource and Oracle. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke Damian, CGO.&lt;/strong&gt; The company promoted Luke Damian to Chief Growth Officer, responsible for the Go-To-Market (GTM) organization. Formerly Applause’s SVP of GTM Strategy, in this new capacity Luke is responsible for all facets of GTM execution – including Strategy, Marketing, Product, Solutions Consulting and Sales Enablement, Operations &amp; Intelligence – with an eye towards growth and acceleration. Prior to Applause, Luke held national sales and business development leadership positions at Oracle and EMC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad Batchelder, CPO.&lt;/strong&gt; The company promoted Brad Batchelder to Chief People Officer. Formerly Applause’s SVP of HR, Brad is responsible for the company’s employee experience – driving talent strategies, culture and employee programming, and overall people strategy. He is also responsible for the company’s human resources, philanthropy and Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DEI) functions, in addition to being the driver of Applause’s award-winning culture. Prior to Applause, Brad held recruiting and talent acquisition roles at Monster and Enterprise Search.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause works with the top brands in virtually every industry vertical today, and has particular depth and expertise in use cases where brands are reacting to the rapid pace of change in digital interactions with their customers, including: Media &amp; Telecommunications, Retail, Financial Services, Healthcare, Travel &amp; Hospitality and Software &amp; Technology. In all instances, Applause brings a wealth of knowledge and experience with the business drivers that shape digital interactions with customers, and insight on how to best test digital assets and experiences to deliver actionable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This value has been acknowledged through the series of global industry awards Applause won in 2021, including the Stevie People’s Choice Award for Favorite Company, Germany’s CX1 Award for CX Enabler, a gold ranking for Best DevOps Solution along with two bronze honors in the International Business Awards, and a silver ranking for Most Innovative Enterprise Product at the 2021 Best in Biz International Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause also continued to win cultural accolades and employee honors, having received the following awards in 2021: “Best Workplaces” from Inc. Magazine, “Top Places to Work” from The Boston Globe, “Best Places to Work” from Boston Business Journal and “100 Best Places to Work in the Nation” from Built In.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Delivers Record-Breaking Year, Surpassing $150 Million in Annualized Recurring Revenue as Momentum for Testing and Digital Quality Accelerates Worldwide` ...</div>

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in enabling digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, today announced it has been named one of the Boston Globe’s best workplaces for the fourth straight year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Top Places to Work recognizes the most admired workplaces in the state voted on by the people who know them best—their employees. The survey measures employee opinions about their company’s direction, execution, connection, management, work, pay and benefits, and engagement. The rankings in Top Places to Work are based on confidential survey information collected by Energage (formerly WorkplaceDynamics), an independent company specializing in employee engagement and retention, from more than 80,000 individuals at 363 Massachusetts organizations. The winners share a few key traits, including offering more flexibility to continue working remotely, tracking progress on efforts to support a diverse workforce, and, above all, remembering to have some fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The workplace is undergoing a once-in-a-lifetime transformation, and the companies that embraced that change, and put their employees’ needs first, really stood out,” said Katie Johnston, the Globe’s Top Places to Work editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause’s company culture was also recognized on a national stage by both &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:382700@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/applause-named-built-in-best-places-to-work}&quot;&gt;Built In&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:431575@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/inc-magazine-applause-top-place-to-work}&quot;&gt;Inc. Magazine&lt;/a&gt; earlier in 2021 on their lists of the United State’s top workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The company’s commitment to excellence extends beyond internal culture to its best-in-class testing solutions, enterprise-grade platform, continuous innovation, global community and customer focus. That’s why the Boston Globe, Built In and Inc. Magazine honors were just three of 10 awards Applause won in 2021. Other notable honors include the Stevie People’s Choice Award for Favorite Company, Germany’s CX1 Award for CX Enabler, a gold ranking for Best DevOps Solution along with two bronze honors in the International Business Awards, and a silver ranking for Most Innovative Enterprise Product at the 2021 Best in Biz International Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Applause’s culture is built on a foundation of customer obsession, open and honest communication, and a ruthless focus on digital quality,” said Bradley Batchelder, Applause’s SVP of People. “These global awards demonstrate that we are making an international impact in helping the world’s leading brands deliver uncommonly great digital experiences to their end users. And we are doing so while providing a world-class and award-winning employee culture that is driven by empowerment, recognition and reward.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in enabling digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, today announced the 2021 results of its annual global survey on holiday shopping trends. The survey took place in October with more than 2,800 respondents from across the Americas, EMEA and APAC. The research showed substantial changes year-over-year in how and where consumers intend to buy this holiday season, with an increase in both online shopping and comfort with making in-store purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;While Applause’s research found that digital shopping is on the rise, how users buy online is changing. In the 2020 survey, 53% said they prefer to do their online shopping via laptop or computer with the remaining 47% opting for a smartphone or tablet. This year the roles reversed: 57.5% said they preferred a mobile device while 42.5% chose the computer or laptop option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In a welcome change, 69% said they feel comfortable returning to physical locations – a sharp increase from Applause’s 2020 survey where less than half (46%) of the respondents said they felt comfortable shopping in-store. The survey found that 45% of those who plan to visit in-store locations for their holiday shopping plan to spend less than they did in 2020. Of the 91% who said they plan to shop online, 68% plan to spend the same amount or more online than they did last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Even with more consumers planning to visit brick-and-mortar shops, retailers should focus on the digital experiences they deliver to end users. Omnichannel shopping continues to be a favorite for consumers looking to stay safe during the pandemic, with 58% using services like curbside pickup, BOPIS (buy online, pick up in-store) and BORIS (buy online, return in-store), and 66% saying they are more likely to shop with a brand if they offer omnichannel options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“COVID-19 has greatly impacted how consumers shop and what options they expect from their favorite retailers,” said Luke Damian, Applause’s Chief Growth Officer. “Retailers must evolve their digital and omnichannel experiences to align to new norms that not only mandate greater function and ease of use, but also expand on safety and convenience. To deliver great experiences to end users, regardless of where they take place, retailers will greatly benefit from conducting real-world testing to ensure they can provide shopping options that are intuitive, enjoyable and that work every single time without fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There is still work to be done when it comes to omnichannel shopping, however, as 24% of those who had used curbside pickup before reported issues finding where to park in order to receive their item and/or had trouble identifying the option for curbside pickup on their digital device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The ways in which people prefer to pay are evolving too. Globally, credit (38.5%) and debit cards (32.7%) ranked as the preferred choice for holiday shopping across the globe, followed by mobile wallets (14.2%) and then cash (11.3%). Mobile wallets were an especially popular choice in APAC and EMEA where 26% and 16%, respectively, named them their payment method of choice. Only in the Americas did cash outrank mobile wallets by a slight margin of 9% to 8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Other key findings from the survey include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Price remained the biggest factor for online purchases; Thirty-nine percent (39%) of respondents in 2021 and 40% in 2020 listed price as their chief consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Encountering a bug during the checkout process is the top reason that shoppers will abandon their purchases, according to over half (52%) of respondents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Supply chain and inventory issues are causing consumers to rethink their holiday shopping schedules: Globally, 40% of respondents said supply chain/inventory issues would factor into their holiday shopping plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in enabling digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, today released the results of its most recent customer satisfaction survey. The company achieved a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 61.7, which is double the average for B2B software and SaaS brands, according to customer experience management firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/&quot;&gt;Relently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The world’s leading brands count on us to help them launch exceptional digital experiences at the scale and speed their end users demand,” said Luke Damian, Applause’s Chief Growth Officer. “Our community of digital experts is global and distributed in nature so we can curate testing teams on demand, anywhere in the world and at any time, which makes our clients’ lives easier, helps them maintain business continuity and allows them to release with confidence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Applause’s customer satisfaction scores have continued to rise over the past year and a half as the company recorded a new record-high NPS each and every quarter. Customers consistently highlighted the comprehensive testing coverage Applause provides on different devices, operating systems and configurations across the demographics and geographies they need. The exceptional quality of results and the speed at which they are delivered to customers were recurring themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Working with Applause extends and strengthens Avon’s QA capabilities to enable a higher delivery velocity and quality through a better test coverage across a range of devices, operating systems, browsers and geographies,” said Laszlo Murvai-Buzogany, Director of Digital Core Capabilities at Avon. “In addition to Applause testers helping identify issues around functionality, user experience and stability, we are at least equally proud of the adaptive partnership with Applause, geared to best support Avon’s needs in a quickly changing internal and external environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Walmart recently expanded its InHome delivery service – where Walmart employees install a smart lock onto a customer’s front or garage door and then deliver products and groceries directly into the customer’s garage, kitchen and even refrigerator using a one-time access code for the smart lock. Orders are made through the InHome app and the entire process is recorded by the Walmart employee so that the customer can view the delivery in the app as it happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The service debuted in Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Vero Beach, Florida, and was recently added in Arkansas, Southeast Florida and Atlanta. When Walmart needed to test InHome with real users completing real customer journeys, it turned to Applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“InHome makes customers&#039; days easier by delivering groceries, picking up returns, and above all, bringing Walmart&#039;s high standards of service beyond our customers&#039; doors,” said Evan Abel, Product Manager, New Product Innovation at Walmart. “Keeping that promise takes rigorous hardware and software testing with real users in real-life environments that could only be achieved with Applause. Every operational step of delivery, every new feature we develop, and every customer contact point through their journey from orders-placed to fridge-filled is tested. Applause helps make InHome a service our customers can rely on and look forward to inviting over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The high customer satisfaction rates extend beyond Applause’s surveys to review sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/application-testing-services-worldwide/vendor/applause/product/applause-application-testing-services-worldwide/reviews?sort=-helpfulness&quot;&gt;Gartner Peer Insights&lt;/a&gt; where Applause has an all-time average rating of 4.8 out of five stars and a perfect 5-star average over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2@1:url||https://www.applause.com/}&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in enabling digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, today released the results of its global survey about telehealth services. The survey, which took place in July 2021 and gathered more than 5,000 responses, found that nearly half (46%) of respondents had used telehealth services at least once – 84% of whom used telehealth as a way to avoid in-person activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We continue to see exceptional digital experiences be the key differentiator for brands across all industries, and healthcare is no exception,” said Luke Damian, Applause’s Chief Growth Officer. “Telehealth is fast moving from a nice-to-have to a must-have service. And not only will healthcare providers need to offer telehealth options, they must ensure the experience itself is easy, intuitive and enjoyable to use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While telehealth is not new, advances in video meeting apps, smartphone availability and broadband access are enabling more use cases. In 2020, many of those use cases included delivering expanded types of care digitally, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from the survey show that it is quickly gaining traction and has staying power. It is a trend that analyst groups like Gartner are also seeing accelerate at a rapid pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3999524-product-leader-insight-guide-to-the-2021-healthcare-prov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product Leader Insight: Guide to the 2021 Healthcare Provider CIO Survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Gartner analysts found that, “while the pandemic delayed some technology investments, other investments like virtual care were dramatically accelerated. Indeed, telehealth remains the most common technology investment area for 2021.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news for telehealth providers is that most respondents (63%) to Applause’s survey stated they plan to use telehealth more than they did prior to the pandemic. What’s more, over three-fourths (77%) of patients stated they enjoyed using telehealth, despite the fact that 48% said there were things they could not do via the telehealth service that they would like to have done. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a large population of patients to what telehealth could be and they want to see more services made available digitally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While telehealth is on the rise globally, EMEA respondents lagged behind others in their use of such services. About half of respondents in the Americas (51%) and APAC (49%) have already used telehealth services, while only around a third (37%) of those in EMEA have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest barrier to telehealth adoption across all regions, according to the survey, is access and availability. Among the 54% of respondents who had not used telehealth services, 46% reported this option was unavailable to them, 39% reported they preferred to see their doctors in person and 8% reported they had no need to consult with a doctor recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banner Health, one of the country’s largest nonprofit healthcare systems, operates hospitals, urgent care clinics, long-term care facilities, family clinics and surgical centers in six states. When Banner Health launched a new telehealth platform in response to COVID-19, the organization turned to Applause to test its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the things that has set us up for success over the past year and half is the work we’ve done with Applause around our design system. While you can’t predict every experience that you’re going to have to make, if you have a solid foundation and a solid competency around your design system and knowing that it’s tested, and that it is also accessible, it prepares you for the future of unexpected experiences, like standing up a last-minute telehealth experience,” said Mark Schumacher, Senior Director of Digital Experience at Banner Health. “Knowing that things are tested for accessibility and usability are different ways that can help you move fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in enabling digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, today announced the appointment of Chris Malone to Chief Executive Officer. Malone joined Applause in 2013, previously serving as President and Chief Financial Officer, and will continue as a member of the company’s board of directors. Malone succeeds Applause’s former CEO and Founder, Doron Reuveni, who will now serve as Executive Chairman of the company’s board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his tenure, Malone has been instrumental in Applause’s growth, having been responsible for the company’s global operations, as well as financial and strategic management. He has also taken Applause through multiple rounds of financing with leading investors, such as Goldman Sachs and Accenture, and stewarded the company through its acquisition by Vista Equity Partners in 2017. Malone has a long and successful track record in scaling global businesses, having held leadership roles in both public and private companies, and managed global books of business exceeding $1 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am honored to be Applause’s next CEO,” said Malone. “I want to thank Doron for his leadership and contributions to Applause, and I am excited to lead the company and build on the strong foundation Doron established. We remain committed to enabling our customers to deliver exceptional digital experiences – at speed and scale. We will continue to accelerate our customers’ ability to lead their respective industries through our unequalled ability to deliver real-world insights into the quality of their digital assets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since founding Applause (formerly uTest) in 2007, Reuveni led the creation of the crowdtesting market and solidified Applause’s position as the market leader – leading the company through thirteen consecutive years of growth since its inception. Although the idea of “in-the-wild” software testing was a radical notion when Applause was founded, today it has become an integral part of the software development process for thousands of enterprises worldwide. Reuveni’s leadership has made him an internationally recognized expert in software development, testing, and entrepreneurship. He will continue to bring these experiences to bear as Executive Chairman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I founded Applause, I was trying to solve a problem in the market that no one was able to address. I am very proud of what we have achieved over the past thirteen years, and it has been a privilege to lead Applause through this robust period of growth and profitability,” said Reuveni. “Chris’ past experience, both at other organizations and at Applause, will ensure that the company carries on addressing the complex digital quality needs of the world’s most influential brands. Applause could not be in more capable hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chris has been instrumental to Applause’s success. We have all realized the benefits of his outstanding mix of strategic and operational experience, and we have full confidence that Applause will continue to scale under his leadership,” said Kim Eaton, Managing Director at Vista Equity Partners and member of the Applause board of directors. “As the worldwide leader in digital quality, Applause has a tremendous growth opportunity in serving the needs of digital-first organizations. We’re grateful to continue our partnership with Doron as Executive Chairman, and we’re excited to see what Chris and the team will achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This announcement closely follows a period of significant growth for Applause. The company’s remote, distributed testing model proved vital to its customers, especially during the global pandemic when enterprises were responding to real-time changes in how to engage with customers digitally. Applause’s flexible and scalable model not only served as a growth driver for the business, but also led to an all-time-high net promoter score, the leading indicator of customer health and satisfaction. “I am proud of how Applause has been able to help our customers address some of the most challenging problems in today’s increasingly digital-first world,” said Malone. “I look forward to continuing to support our clients in achieving their digital strategies, as drivers of business growth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining Applause, Malone held a number of senior leadership roles across finance, sales and operations. He holds a Bachelor’s degree and an MBA from Babson College. Chris currently serves as chairman of Babson’s College Advisory Board, and will be joining the college’s Board of Trustees later this year.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Appoints Chris Malone to Chief Executive Officer` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in enabling digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, today announced the appointment of Jason Mills to its Board of Directors. An established leader in the technology industry, Mills’ focus on business strategy, innovation and digital transformation for Fortune 100 companies supports Applause’s mission to empower the world’s leading companies to deliver exceptional digital experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mills is currently the Executive Director and Head of Customer Engineering Cloud Industries at Google, where he leads the industry-aligned team responsible for sales engineering for the top 250 customers in finance, healthcare &amp; life sciences, telecom, media &amp; entertainment, gaming and retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to welcome Jason Mills to Applause’s Board of Directors. The knowledge he possesses of technology across vertical industries makes him an invaluable addition to our team,” said Doron Reuveni, Applause’s CEO, Founder and Chairman of the Board. “His experience working with some of the world’s largest and most innovative digital brands aligns with our continued focus on a comprehensive approach to product excellence for global enterprises and their end users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to his work at Google, Mills held several technology leadership roles at JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup. He also co-founded BLISTS, Inc., a non-profit organization specializing in technology and economic development in underdeveloped communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throughout my career, I have placed special emphasis on creating and delivering technology strategies that will both grow the companies I work with and benefit their customers and end users,” said Mills. “I am honored to join the board at Applause, a company that shares these same values, to help continue its category leadership and build upon its existing foundation of technology excellence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mills joins Applause’s existing Board of Directors effective immediately. The search for Mills was supported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Vista Equity Partner’s&lt;/a&gt; independent board program, which leverages the firm’s network to source qualified board candidates for its portfolio companies.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Visionary Technologist Jason Mills Joins Applause Board of Directors` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in enabling digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, today announced the availability of its new SaaS product – Applause Codeless Automation (ACA). Applause Codeless Automation helps brands quickly scale their test automation strategies by enabling anyone to create test automation scripts – regardless of experience level or programming expertise – without writing a single line of code. ACA is compliant with modern open-source frameworks, including Selenium and Appium, and works with both native Android and iOS apps, with support for web applications coming soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause’s new SaaS product is the first enterprise-grade codeless test automation product on the market. With ACA, users simply click through the pathways of an app within the product, which captures the steps and creates a test script. From there, users can run the tests on real devices and execute tests within the ACA product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACA is part of Applause’s &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:846745@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-testing-platform}&quot;&gt;Product Excellence Platform&lt;/a&gt; – a holistic platform that delivers all the expertise, products, solutions and infrastructure needed to empower the world’s leading brands to release exceptional digital experiences to their end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title as-h4&quot;&gt;Key Test Automation Challenges Persist According to Survey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of programming experience and test automation expertise are common problems for brands across the world, according to a global survey of more than 2,000 people in product, engineering, QA and DevOps roles. The survey was conducted by Applause in February 2021. Key findings from the survey include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;56% of respondents plan to adopt a codeless test automation solution. Respondents cited improved test coverage, ability to mature test automation faster and cost savings as the three most common drivers for purchasing a codeless automation product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those companies that are currently using low or minimal levels of test automation, 41% say that the biggest roadblock to automation success is a lack of skilled/experienced test automation experts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those that have made significant investments in test automation, the challenges are more diverse: 20% say that their automation progress is too slow and is not providing the expected level of coverage. Another 18% cited a lack of test automation resources as a key challenge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The data indicates that when teams have more people who can write test automation scripts, they are able to automate a higher percentage of their test cases, highlighting the importance of enabling more users to build automation without needing programming expertise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;74% of the companies that have three or fewer team members capable of writing test automation are automating less than 30% of their test cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;35% of those that have 10-plus team members capable of writing test automation, however, are automating more than 70% of their test cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Traditional automation is still an essential part of any enterprise’s testing strategy. However, it’s clear that – especially when it comes to getting the necessary resources – businesses are struggling to leverage test automation to its full potential. That’s where Applause Codeless Automation can really benefit brands,” said Rob Mason, CTO of Applause. “ACA can take the pressure off of internal experts, particularly for less complex scenarios like smoke testing and portions of a regression testing suite. This ultimately allows teams to focus on higher-priority projects and mature test automation faster without the cost of additional resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{entry:218737@1:url||https://www.applause.com/contact-us}&quot;&gt;Contact Applause&lt;/a&gt; to receive a demo of ACA.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class='progress-msg'>[22:34:08] - Custom field `_et_pb_old_content` will be updated with value `Silos slow development and hurt QA efficiency, leading to more expensive, buggier releases; New Applause In-Sprint Testing offering shifts testing left in the SDLC for a faster, more iterative process that results in higher quality and increased release velocity

&lt;p&gt;Software development productivity is increasingly impacted by testing demands and siloed processes, according to new data from Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in enabling digital quality&lt;/a&gt;. These issues negatively affect the speed at which brands can release new features to their end users; they also hit brands’ bottom lines – as bugs become more expensive and require added effort to fix when found later on in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings come from Applause’s April 2021 survey of more than 1,800 QA, product, engineering and DevOps professionals across the globe on the state of shift-left testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey found that, when done correctly, shifting testing left provides unique benefits. Respondents noted that the three top drivers for shifting left are to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the number of bugs released to end users;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save the costs of later-stage bug fixes;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Release features/builds faster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many organizations still face challenges with their shift-left strategy. The survey found that the top two barriers to successfully shifting left are that developers are too busy coding and that development and QA efforts remain siloed. Organizations that have already shifted left face many of the same roadblocks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fifty-two percent of respondents said the time their organizations’ developers spend on testing is impacting their productivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly half (44%) of respondents at large organizations that are already shifting left said their development teams spend a full work day every single week just testing new features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the benefits of shifting left are clear, the right processes and technology must be in place to do so successfully. To help brands realize these benefits and the full potential of shifting left, Applause today announced the availability of its new offering, &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:398899@1:url||https://www.applause.com/in-sprint-testing}&quot;&gt;Applause In-Sprint Testing&lt;/a&gt;. The offering, which was previewed earlier this year as part of Applause’s &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:600004@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-testing-platform}&quot;&gt;Product Excellence Platform&lt;/a&gt;, helps organizations shift their testing earlier in the SDLC and augments internal teams’ ability to test smaller chunks of code quickly and in an iterative model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Applause In-Sprint Testing, a developer sends a feature for testing directly to Applause’s SaaS platform with the click of a button. This simple, one-click process is enabled by Applause’s bi-directional integrations with the leading bug tracking systems. Once the feature goes to Applause, a pre-built team of testers sourced from Applause’s global community of digital experts starts testing the core functionality of the feature right away so that results can be returned almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new offering not only speeds up release velocity and improves quality by making testing easier and more iterative throughout the SDLC, it also reduces context switching – which 44% of developers in Applause’s survey highlighted as a current issue at their organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Applause In-Sprint Testing is designed to help the world’s leading brands maintain and improve quality while keeping up with the speed demands of Agile methodologies,” said Jan Wolter, General Manager of Applause EU. “It takes only a single click to start testing and results are logged directly into the customer’s bug tracking system for ease of use. The entire process takes place within just hours, so that the customer’s developers get immediate results and don’t risk having to re-acclimate themselves to code from days or weeks earlier, as is often the case when organizations don’t have a solution like Applause In-Sprint Testing in place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, the worldwide leader in enabling digital quality, today launched its first-of-a-kind &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:600004@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-testing-platform}&quot;&gt;Product Excellence Platform (PEP)&lt;/a&gt;. The PEP provides the comprehensive approach to quality that brands need to deliver exceptional digital experiences to their end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does so by combining world-class software products, an enterprise-grade SaaS testing infrastructure, a wide range of digital testing solutions and access to the world’s largest community of digital experts. This harmonized approach gives brands the insights and expertise they need to release their digital assets with greater velocity and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital experiences are the principal ways that brands connect with their customers, a trend that was only exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Product Excellence Platform gives brands the unparalleled insight into the quality and completeness of their digital assets that they need to meet the demands of today’s end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Customers today are won and lost through digital experiences. That is why the quality of digital assets – mobile apps, websites, voice-driven experiences and more – is critical to get right,” said Doron Reuveni, Applause’s CEO, Founder and Chairman of the Board. “To meet these needs, Applause continues to disrupt the testing market, having evolved from a services and solutions company to one that delivers a complete platform for driving product excellence. While others offer point tools, the PEP is the first holistic answer for digital quality and product excellence for the enterprise. This focus on quality and exceptionalism helps our clients ensure their end users keep coming back to the digital experiences they love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause Product Excellence Platform is completely open and integrates with clients’ existing processes for ease of use. It is built on five core pillars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SaaS Products: &lt;/strong&gt;Offerings currently include the Applause Codeless Automation and &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:217467@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/leverage-internal-testers-without-headaches}&quot;&gt;Bring Your Own Testers (BYOT)&lt;/a&gt; SaaS products. Later this year, a test case management product will also launch, meeting a range of diverse client needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Point Testing Solutions:&lt;/strong&gt; Fully integrated functional testing capabilities and specialized testing work together as part of the PEP to solve for the complexities that exist across customer interactions and journeys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Domain Expertise:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Strong domain knowledge of a wide range of vertical industries and use cases, including retail, media &amp; entertainment, financial services, travel &amp; hospitality, healthcare and IoT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise-Class SaaS Infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt; The open and enterprise-class SaaS infrastructure that underpins the Product Excellence Platform integrates seamlessly into clients’ existing SDLC, testing and development processes to speed up testing and increase release velocity and confidence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Testing Community:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Applause’s uTest community of digital experts serves as the foundation of the PEP, connecting the world’s innovators with the world’s users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Applause also announced two new offerings that expand the footprint of the Product Excellence Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;Applause Codeless Automation SaaS Product Generates Test Scripts Quickly and Easily&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the pace of change moving faster than ever, the quality of digital experiences and the speed at which they can be delivered has become paramount. Brands must get exceptional digital assets into the hands of their end users quicker than competitors, or they risk losing market share. This requirement for quality at the speed of development has led test automation to take on greater importance across all industries. However, building and maintaining a complete automation framework takes time, and hiring SDETs (Software Development Engineer in Test) – who are high in demand and low in supply – can be cost-prohibitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these needs, Applause today announced its new Applause Codeless Automation (ACA) SaaS product. ACA enables brands’ employees to create test automation scripts without writing a single line of code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ACA, any user can simply pick a device of their choice, and as they move through the test case, their actions are automatically recorded. The ACA product then translates that session into an automation script. This streamlined process results in increased speed, faster releases and reduced costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new software offering lowers the barrier to entry to automation, accelerates teams’ ability to drive coverage and allows them to mature and scale their test automation capabilities. Seamless integration with leading environments through an open API enables teams to execute codeless test scripts on real devices for native Android and iOS mobile apps, with Web support coming soon. All issues are automatically captured and added to clients’ existing bug tracking systems, and scripts will comply with Appium and Selenium for ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Applause Codeless Automation product is something unique in the low-code/no-code testing space, as it is built for the enterprise – starting with the most advanced mobile support for both iOS and Android,” said Rob Mason, CTO of Applause. “ACA is valuable for multiple stakeholders – those responsible for business applications can use ACA to test apps without needing SDETs or outside help, and DevOps managers can import the test scripts generated by ACA into their existing pipelines. By addressing testing needs throughout organizations, ACA has the power to not only reduce the costs typically associated with automation, but it will also help brands get to full-fledged automation capabilities faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about ACA, please &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:218737@1:url||https://www.applause.com/contact-us}&quot;&gt;contact Applause&lt;/a&gt; to receive a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;Applause In-Sprint Testing Helps Organizations Shift Testing Left and Close Development Tickets Faster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{entry:398899@1:url||https://www.applause.com/in-sprint-testing}&quot;&gt;Applause In-Sprint Testing&lt;/a&gt; shifts testing further left in the SDLC so that issues are identified earlier on and can be fixed faster. This testing of features as they are being developed helps make the development and testing process more iterative and lowers the cost of bug fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause’s API capabilities and two-way integration with clients’ bug tracking systems mean in-sprint testing can be executed entirely from within brands’ systems and processes. Developers can send new features to Applause for manual testing and receive feedback and results almost immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quick turnaround means teams can identify issues earlier in the process to avoid late-stage bug fixes and the higher costs that come with them, and developers don’t have to risk context switching or re-acclimating themselves to code from days or weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause is committed to delivering more value to clients through the Product Excellence Platform. As a result of this evolution to a platform company, new features, solutions and SaaS products will be announced throughout the year and integrated into the PEP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2@1:url||https://www.applause.com/}&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today announced it was granted its Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) certification as a validation of its status as a minority-owned business. The certification verifies that Applause meets the criteria defined by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), which requires a business to be at least 51% owned, operated and controlled by racial or ethnic minorities who are also U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Applause is a global enterprise that thrives because of the diversity and inclusiveness of our employees and our worldwide community of over 600,000 digital experts,” said Doron Reuveni, Founder and CEO of Applause. “Getting our MBE certification was a natural next step for Applause as it continues our ongoing commitment to diversity and equality. We look forward to working with our clients, partners and other MBE-certified businesses to continue to build on these values.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Applause, many of its clients are also passionate about diversity and inclusion, and many have specific supplier spend requirements to ensure diversity in their supply chains. The MBE certification demonstrates Applause&#039;s commitment to helping customers fulfill their own aspirations to continuously commit to social good for their own employees and end users through their supply chain fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause is committed to working with suppliers and vendors that come from a wide range of backgrounds to incorporate all perspectives so that they are considered and included accordingly. In doing so, Applause is focused on ensuring the chain of supply for minority- and women-owned resources are making a meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are over 400 national corporate members that are recognized as part of the NMSDC, and more than 1,450 corporate members through the 23 regional NMSDC affiliates. Applause is proud to join the ranks of these members and other minority-owned businesses that have a continuous and ongoing focus on diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;Additional Resources:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn more &lt;a href=&quot;https://nmsdc.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;about the NMSDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read the blog about Applause&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:369393@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/applause-granted-mbe-certification}&quot;&gt;commitment to diversity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn more &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2@1:url||https://www.applause.com/}&quot;&gt;about Applause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;` for post `Applause Certified as a Minority-Owned Business` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2@1:url||https://www.applause.com/}&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today announced it was recognized by the Boston Globe as one of the top places to work in Massachusetts. This is the third year in a row Applause has been featured on Boston Globe’s annual list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Globe’s &lt;em&gt;Top Places to Work&lt;/em&gt; rankings are based on confidential survey information from more than 80,000 individuals at 285 Massachusetts organizations. The winners share a few key traits, including offering progressive benefits, giving their employees a voice and encouraging them to have some fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a particularly challenging year to be a great place to work, and the companies that made our list went above and beyond to keep their employees safe, engaged and cared for,” said Katie Johnston, the Globe’s &lt;em&gt;Top Places to Work&lt;/em&gt;
editor. “From offering help with childcare to making the workplace more equitable to holding virtual talent shows, these employers showed that the best get better in crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The honor from the Boston Globe comes after Applause was named a best place to work in similar reports by Inc. Magazine and Boston Business Journal earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inc. Magazine &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:170710@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/inc-names-applause-a-best-workplace}&quot;&gt;named Applause&lt;/a&gt; as part of its annual list showcasing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/best-workplaces/2020.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;nation’s best places to work&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting data from more than 3,000 submissions, Inc. singled out fewer than 400 finalists for this year’s list. Each nominated company took part in an employee survey on topics including trust, management effectiveness, perks and confidence in the future. Inc. gathered, analyzed and audited the data, then ranked all the employers using a composite score of survey results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{entry:188071@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/bbj-names-applause-best-place-to-work}&quot;&gt;Boston Business Journal&lt;/a&gt; also ranked Applause as one of the best places to work in Massachusetts in back-to-back years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;Applause Brings Home Multiple Company, Product and Innovation Awards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause won a combined seven awards this year – three gold, two silver and two bronze honors – across the International Business Awards, American Business Awards and Best in Biz International Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause was recognized twice at the &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:173374@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/applause-wins-american-business-awards}&quot;&gt;American Business Awards&lt;/a&gt;, earning gold in the Company of the Year category, as well as the Best New AI/ML Product of the Year category for its &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:226294@1:url||https://www.applause.com/ai-training-testing}&quot;&gt;AI Training &amp; Testing solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause won gold in the Company of the Year category at the &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:215322@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/applause-wins-three-stevies-at-ibas}&quot;&gt;International Business Awards&lt;/a&gt;, while also taking home silver honors in the Most Innovative Tech Company and Best New Product of the Year categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite the unprecedented impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on organizations and working people worldwide, the number and quality of nominations we received in this year’s International Business Awards attests to the continued outstanding performance of many organizations. The commitment we’ve seen through these nominations to maintaining the success, health and safety of employees, customers and communities is truly impressive,” said Maggie Gallagher, President of both the American and International Business Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause also received two bronze honors in the Most Innovative Company and Most Innovative Product categories as part of the Best in Biz International Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2@1:url||https://www.applause.com/}&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today revealed three new initiatives from Applause Labs – the company’s R&amp;D and innovation engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause Labs team is focused on accelerating innovation, with the goal of exploring and developing new features and solutions that will benefit both Applause’s clients and community of testers. Applause’s crowdsourced community, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot;&gt;uTest&lt;/a&gt;, is the world’s largest, most diverse group of digital experts. Consisting of vetted and trained testers in a variety of disciplines – including manual, automated, usability and accessibility testing, among other areas – the community enables the world’s leading brands to test in the real world, in a flexible, responsive and efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two features to come out of Applause Labs – the &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:159298@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/put-a-number-to-your-release-readiness}&quot;&gt;Applause Quality Score&lt;/a&gt; and the Applause Accessibility Tool – were designed to help clients and end users. The latest Applause Labs initiatives are primarily focused on improving the tester experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;title as-h2&quot;&gt;Geo-Location Capabilities for Customer Journey Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause’s &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:226186@1:url||https://www.applause.com/customer-journey-testing}&quot;&gt;Customer Journey Testing solution&lt;/a&gt; is in high demand. Restaurants and retailers are continuing to reinvent themselves by offering new customer journeys, such as contactless payments and curbside pickup. These types of customer journeys are new to many brands – often being added as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure customer safety – and require the real-world testing that only Applause can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of Applause’s Customer Journey Testing solution has required a new way to more easily target testers with projects based on their locations, and enable them to seamlessly participate in Customer Journey Testing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the annual &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2448@1:url||https://www.applause.com/vista-equity-partners-acquires-applause}&quot;&gt;Vista Equity Partners&lt;/a&gt; Hackathon, and using the recently released uTest mobile app, Applause Labs developed a way for testers to opt-in to provide their geo-location data, enabling them to receive more personalized and geo-specific invitations to test cycles. This gives testers more opportunities to test and earn money while also providing clients with a more targeted group of testers with which to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;title as-h2&quot;&gt;Device Recommendations &amp; Virtual Device Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more devices a tester has access to, the more project opportunities they have. Most testing must be done on a specific device (such as an iPhone 11 or Samsung Galaxy s9) to accurately represent the real-world experience on particular devices. Applause Labs prototyped ways to provide testers with insight into the devices that were most sought after and requested by clients, so that they understand what devices they should invest in to get more testing project invites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause Labs also prototyped a virtual device cloud, which enables users to conduct manual functional testing – including both exploratory testing and test case execution – without actually owning the physical device that is being tested. With this virtual device cloud, a community member could, for example, complete exploratory testing on a virtual iPhone 12 without actually owning or having access to a physical iPhone 12. The technology for this virtual device cloud is all handled by Applause, so that testers don’t need any coding experience themselves to complete the testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are fully committed to innovation and delivering the best possible features to our clients, their end users and our community members,” said Jonathan Zaleski, Head of Applause Labs. “Our most recent exploration, ideation and prototypes have been focused on improving the tester experience to give community members more opportunities to test and earn money. These innovations would also benefit clients over time as they will have a larger pool of testers with the relevant devices to leverage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today announced the availability of its Bring Your Own Testers (BYOT) feature that enables clients to manage their internal teams – employees, friends, family members and existing customers – and invite them to test cycles in the Applause Platform alongside Applause’s vetted and expert community of testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times, organizations want to engage their employees or a network of customer advocates who can provide early feedback on a new release or capability. The Bring Your Own Testers feature leverages Applause’s established SaaS platform and processes for tester management, test execution, and delivery of results so that organizations can take advantage of both the Applause Community as well as their own internal teams that can provide valuable testing and user feedback. BYOT eliminates the time and infrastructure that internal management of this process typically requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Engineering and QA teams are constantly trying to test and release software builds faster and more frequently. One of the biggest roadblocks to this goal is an organization’s ability to manage all facets and parties involved in testing as the scale increases,” said Doron Reuveni, Founder and CEO at Applause. “Bring Your Own Testers solves this problem by providing the established and trusted Applause Platform as a means to manage both internal and external testing teams. This not only offloads the process-oriented work that can slow down Engineering and QA, but also provides a holistic view of results from all testers within a single platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three primary benefits of the Bring Your Own Testers feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Applause’s fully managed service: &lt;/strong&gt;BYOT enables organizations to engage with their internal teams in a way that may otherwise be impossible. Applause’s team manages the setup, execution and delivery of results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded testing results and feedback: &lt;/strong&gt;Organizations receive richer testing results and feedback by leveraging Applause’s global, expert community in addition to their internal teams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A seamless experience for internal teams: &lt;/strong&gt;Applause makes it easy for an organization’s internal teams to start testing and reporting actionable bugs and feedback. Teams are registered and onboarded through a simple, customer-branded experience so testing can begin quickly. Once testing has started, internal teams can easily access builds, report issues containing all the necessary information, upload videos and provide valuable user feedback all through the Applause Platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today launched its Integrated Functional Testing solution. The new solution integrates manual and automated testing to help brands accelerate development velocity and improve digital quality. Applause is the first and only testing services company to offer this coordinated solution, as well as a single dashboard to view all results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A balance between manual and automated testing is an essential part of any company’s testing strategy. However, test automation and manual testing often function on separate paths, leading to redundancy and a failure to maximize test coverage. Integrated Functional Testing solves this problem by combining a real-world, crowdsourced approach for manual testing with an automation framework that integrates seamlessly into enterprises’ CI/CD pipelines for increased release velocity and digital superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Integrated Functional Testing is a first for the testing industry, in that it is a holistic solution for both manual and automated testing. Unlike automation tools that are built for a singular purpose, Integrated Functional Testing gives brands insight and visibility into the complete range of testing methods, workflows and results,” said Doron Reuveni, Founder and CEO of Applause. “This holistic approach to testing and quality saves time by eliminating the burdens of working across multiple systems, and saves money by quickly and fully evaluating the risk of each release – these are benefits typical automation tools cannot offer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manual and automated testing approaches are often siloed within an organization, leading to fragmented reporting and forcing teams to spend additional time and effort to gain a holistic view of quality. Applause’s Integrated Functional Testing allows clients to understand the health of each product, feature or function at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading brands like Priceline are already leveraging Applause for both manual and automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because Priceline is a world leader in travel, our customers expect and trust us to provide an exceptional experience, where they can easily find and book great travel deals,” said Eric Goldberg, VP of Quality Assurance at Priceline. “Since we are constantly making improvements to that experience and our underlying systems, having an effective quality assurance program is essential. The new Applause integrated functional testing approach helps us accomplish this in an efficient and scalable manner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today announced a new partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infosys.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Infosys&lt;/a&gt;, a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting, to provide broader end-to-end digital experience testing services to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infosys.com/services/validation-solutions/alliances/applause.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;The partnership&lt;/a&gt; combines Infosys’ behind-the-firewall validation with Applause’s white-glove crowdtesting approach to deliver tangible results for clients across three focus areas — getting closer to customers, increasing development velocity and delivering high-quality digital experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key benefits of the joint solution include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased speed and scale to test in multiple geographies simultaneously&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Domain and subject matter experts available on demand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shorter user experience testing and feedback cycles with actionable results available in real time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients are already leveraging the solution, with a leading US-based credit card company using it to launch a new card promotion. The promotion was built and hosted by Infosys, and then tested in eight cities by real client customers who were part of a vetted team managed by Applause. Within 10 days, the team identified misclassifications for 15% of the tested transactions and was able to fix the back-end defects before they appeared on cardholder statements. The joint approach enabled the credit card company to deliver a fast and flawless roll-out of the new bonus promotion, driving high customer satisfaction while limiting customer service costs associated with launching a flawed promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause-Infosys partnership will deliver brands accelerated feedback from a full suite of testing capabilities that fit seamlessly into clients’ Agile processes, allowing them to test more frequently, with better device coverage, even faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We invented the crowdtesting category over a decade ago, and we are the place that digital leaders turn to ensure their new customer experiences work flawlessly – on every device, in every language, in any location,” said &lt;strong&gt;Doron Reuveni, founder and CEO of Applause&lt;/strong&gt;. “Every new release and digital experience – whether it’s an app, chatbot or omnichannel purchasing experience – should be tested by actual users in real-world situations. Together we can ensure a broader set of clients can easily access these essential solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mohit Joshi, President, Infosys&lt;/strong&gt;, said, “The relationship with Applause strengthens our ability to offer clients the highest-quality digital testing services. This will ensure that our clients’ digital experiences are validated by real customers and highly vetted testers before new features are released into the market thereby improving our clients’ customer satisfaction ratings.”&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Partners with Infosys to Launch Digital Testing Services for Clients` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2@1:url||https://www.applause.com/}&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today released its new Applause Accessibility Tool that automatically finds and fixes key accessibility issues earlier in the software development lifecycle. The tool comes out of &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:66407@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-launches-applause-labs}&quot;&gt;Applause Labs&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s innovation engine housing its research and development (R&amp;D) and new initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility in digital environments lags behind the physical world, which is a problem for the estimated one billion people globally living with a disability. As more activities become primarily digital, dramatic improvements in digital accessibility are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause Accessibility Tool, available for free download now, integrates seamlessly into the web development process and helps developers identify and resolve a subset of key accessibility issues almost immediately by providing an automated fix or recommendation to resolve each issue, reducing the time and resources associated with fixing issues discovered later in the development process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Digital accessibility is critically important for all brands today – both from a business perspective and for the greater good of consumers and digital experiences,” said Doron Reuveni, Founder and CEO of Applause. “We understand how essential accessibility is, and that is why we are investing so much effort into providing inclusive experiences for all users. Not only does the Applause Accessibility Tool find and fix key issues during the development process, it also educates developers so that the accessibility of apps and websites is improved on a continuing basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause Accessibility Tool complements the company’s existing accessibility testing offering. While the tool can help identify and fix common issues early in the SDLC – resulting in significant time and cost savings – manual evaluation by accessibility experts is required to fully evaluate digital experiences and ensure they are compliant with regulations and guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause’s team of accessibility experts is trained in accessibility laws and standards, and the full suite of human-driven testing processes that should be leveraged alongside the Applause Accessibility Tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a way, accessibility is about survival. We can do almost all daily activities online – everything from paying bills to buying plane tickets. Yet, while the move to digital is supposed to make life easier and more convenient, the opposite can actually be true if digital accessibility isn’t considered early in the process,” said Jonathan Zaleski, Head of Applause Labs. “Accessibility is for everyone, and this new tool will help put accessibility front of mind for developers, making it easier than ever before to identify and fix some of the most common digital accessibility issues early on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause recently conducted a global survey of over 100 QA professionals on how their companies address digital accessibility. While most respondents indicated that digital accessibility was either a high or very high priority, more than half admitted their company’s website didn’t meet, or they were unsure if it met, WCAG 2.1 standards. The top mistakes respondents continue to see on websites include error alerts not being descriptive, site and page structures that are unclear, and sites that cannot be navigated via keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For businesses, there is both a moral and financial incentive to make digital experiences more inclusive. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.usablenet.com/usablenet-releases-its-2019-ada-web-accessibility-and-app-lawsuit-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;UsableNet&lt;/a&gt;, there was one ADA lawsuit case filed every hour in 2019 against inaccessible websites. Businesses are also potentially missing out on a large audience of customers by not providing inclusive experiences, as an estimated 15% of the world’s population lives with a disability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today announced Rob Mason was promoted to Chief Technology Officer. Since joining the company as Senior Vice President of Engineering in November 2017, Mason has established Applause as a top destination for engineering talent, both in the Boston area and across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rob has been instrumental in the growth of our team and our underlying technology platform. Under his leadership, Applause has curated a world-class engineering organization with a focus on customer-centric improvements and next-generation technology,” said Doron Reuveni, founder and CEO of Applause. “His vision and skillset will help us continue building our market-leading solutions to best address our customers’ desire to deliver flawless digital experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Mason’s direction, Applause has increased its focus on innovation and efficiency. The company recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:66407@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-launches-applause-labs}&quot;&gt;Applause Labs&lt;/a&gt;, an innovation engine that houses R&amp;D initiatives and the development of new testing concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the Applause platform through AI and machine learning is a top priority for Mason and his team. Already, they are using AI/ML to better match testers to client projects and optimize the tester payment process. Applause also released a &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:73315@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-ai-testing-solution-detects-bias}&quot;&gt;new training and testing solution&lt;/a&gt; specifically for client AI projects earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Investment in engineering is a top priority at Applause, and it shows in the innovations we’ve made over the past two years,” said Rob Mason, CTO of Applause. “We’ll continue to utilize AI and machine learning to make our platform more valuable for our customers, and we’ll leverage the top engineering talent we have available to build new solutions and address customer needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mason is well versed in leading software development and engineering teams. Before joining Applause, he held multiple roles at Nasuni – a company he co-founded – including President, CTO and Executive Vice President of Engineering. Prior to Nasuni, Rob oversaw all development and quality assurance as the VP of Engineering at Archivas from 2004 through its acquisition by Hitachi. After the acquisition, he continued in his role as VP of HCAP Engineering, managing the integration of his team with Hitachi’s and supporting the broad rollout of HCAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today announced it was identified as a leader in NelsonHall’s latest NEAT evaluation of the crowdtesting market. Applause was also recognized in the analyst firm’s previous version of the report in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We invented the crowdtesting category over a decade ago, and we continue to innovate and execute at a high level in order to extend this leadership position,” said Doron Reuveni, founder and CEO of Applause. “Not only are we a leader among crowdtesting companies, we are disrupting the entire testing services industry with a highly scalable approach that puts customers before all else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Applause continues to make its service portfolio relevant to agile and continuous testing. The company now complements its crowdtesting services with its Applause Platform for test script execution and has a comprehensive continuous testing offering,” said Dominique Raviart, NelsonHall’s IT Services Practice Director. He added: “Also, Applause is investing ahead of the future and is developing AI-based use cases, e.g. duplicate defect identification. These AI use cases will help Applause increase its speed of delivering crowdtesting services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;The Boston Globe Names Applause One of the Best Employers in Massachusetts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not only the analyst community that is taking note of Applause’s progress. The Boston Globe publishes an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/specials/top-places-to-work/2019/11/14/the-top-places-work-massachusetts/tsx9qZhTHmRJjlWVIrL1HP/story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;annual list&lt;/a&gt; to recognize the most admired workplaces in Massachusetts. These companies are decided via employee survey, which measures employee opinions about their company’s direction, execution, connection, management, work, pay and benefits, and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, the Boston Globe ranked Applause as one of the state’s top places to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The companies that make our list are much more than just decent employers,” said Katie Johnston, the Globe’s Top Places to Work editor. “They make work fun, and they make their people feel cared for. Some of them even help employees realize dreams that have nothing to do with their jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top places to work rankings are based on confidential survey information collected by Energage, an independent company specializing in employee engagement and retention, from nearly 66,000 individuals at 323 Massachusetts organizations. The winners share a few key traits, including offering progressive benefits, giving their employees a voice and encouraging them to have some fun while they’re at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;About NelsonHall&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today announced its new solution for AI training and testing. The scalable solution trains algorithms to learn quickly and tests the output to ensure those algorithms are processing and responding appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution leverages Applause’s global community of vetted testers to deliver the widest possible range of training inputs. The results are then tested across every possible device, location and circumstance to identify issues and provide actionable user feedback in real time. This enables today’s leading brands to identify issues of quality or bias earlier in the development process so that they are ultimately delivering top-quality AI experiences for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Users want AI to be more natural, more human. Applause’s crowdsourced approach delivers what AI has been missing: a diverse and large collection of real human interactions prior to release,” said Kristin Simonini, VP of Product at Applause. “Not only will this improve AI experiences for consumers everywhere, the breadth of the community also has the potential to mitigate bias concerns and make AI more representative of the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data Applause collects from the community comes from people across numerous countries, ages, genders, races, cultures, political affiliations, ideologies, socioeconomic and education levels, and more. This broad base of data samples results in a more representative and unbiased output than if the data were sourced from a smaller group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does the Applause Community provide diverse training data sets to power algorithms – it can also test the outputs of those algorithms to check for bias. If bias has crept into an algorithm at any stage, the community can identify it when testing the output, something that a smaller or less diverse group of testers might not be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All types of AI – from virtual assistants learning how different users ask for the same thing, to nutrition apps identifying food from uploaded photos – have been hampered by the same challenge: sourcing enough data to teach the machine how to interpret and respond, and then testing the output at scale to ensure the results are accurate and human-like when necessary. Applause’s solution addresses these challenges directly, across every vertical and platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Applause’s new solution operates across five unique types of AI engagements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Voice: Source utterances to train voice-enabled devices, and test those devices to ensure they understand and respond accurately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Provide documents and corresponding text to train algorithms to recognize text, and compare printed docs and the recognized text for accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Image Recognition: Deliver photos taken of predefined objects and locations, and ensure objects are being recognized and identified correctly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Biometrics: Source biometric inputs like faces and fingerprints, and test whether those inputs result in an experience that’s easy to use and actually works&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chatbots: Give sample questions and varying intents for chatbots to answer, and interact with chatbots to ensure they understand and respond accurately in a human-like way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many AI experiences today fail to meet customers’ expectations. Applause provides rapid, iterative feedback from an end user&#039;s perspective, at all stages of development, to ensure brands are creating an experience customers will want and use.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class='progress-msg'>[22:34:26] - Custom field `_et_pb_old_content` will be updated with value `Releases the Applause Quality Score, the industry’s first standard for enterprise digital quality

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today unveiled Applause Labs, an innovation engine focused on the rapid development and iteration of ideas that will bring next-generation testing concepts to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause Labs is the industry’s largest team dedicated to quality and testing, encompassing current R&amp;D initiatives as well as an expanded focus on developing new testing concepts. Led by industry veteran Jonathan Zaleski, Applause Labs is focused on accelerating innovation and developing new ideas quickly and efficiently, allowing Applause to bring new offerings to market faster than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Applause is built on a foundation of innovation. We invented the crowdtesting industry over a decade ago and are the leader in the category because we put our clients at the center of everything we do,” said Doron Reuveni, founder and CEO of Applause. “The digital vanguard – next-generation companies like Google and eBay – all turn to us for their testing because we deliver value in ways no other company can. Applause Labs continues this history of innovation, allowing us to move faster and deliver impactful solutions to our clients at an even higher rate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Applause Quality Score: Improving quality at the build, release and product level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For brands that are looking to consistently measure and improve the quality of their releases over time, Applause Labs has developed the industry’s first and only quality benchmarking tool built for the enterprise. With over a decade of historical data on what quality looks like, Applause Labs uses client testing results to curate a customized quality score for the company. The resulting Applause Quality Score – a calculated value ranging from 0 to 100 – enables clients to understand the level of quality they are achieving build-over-build, helping them decide when a build is ready for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Applause has been instrumental in our ability to release high-quality digital experiences to our patients,” said Meredith McNeill, QA Manager at Dignity Health. “The Applause Quality Score will further this mission by giving us insight into how our quality is trending over time. This data will help us make those critical go/no-go decisions about when a build is ready to be released to the masses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For over a decade, Applause has worked with the world’s top brands to address digital quality issues. With years of expertise and historical data on what makes a quality app or product, we are uniquely positioned to create a standard for what good looks like,” said Jonathan Zaleski, Head of Applause Labs. “The Applause Quality Score is just the beginning for Applause Labs. We are laser-focused on the exploration and delivery of cutting-edge concepts in testing, including some entirely new product offerings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today announced it received Stevie honors across three separate categories of the 17th annual American Business Awards®. The company also has an opportunity to win a fourth award as part of the People’s Choice voting for the best new product of the year. The awards will be presented to winners at a gala ceremony at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York on Tuesday, June 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 3,800 nominations from organizations of all sizes and in virtually every industry were submitted this year for consideration in a wide range of categories, including Startup of the Year, Executive of the Year, Best New Product or Service of the Year, Marketing Campaign of the Year, Live Event of the Year, and App of the Year, among others. More than 200 professionals worldwide participated in the judging process to select this year’s Stevie Award winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The nominations submitted to The 2019 American Business Awards were outstanding. They illustrate the continued vibrancy of innovation and high level of achievement across the American economic landscape,” said Michael Gallagher, president and founder of the Stevie Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause won a silver Stevie Award in the Best New Product of the Year category for its Applause for Amazon Alexa offering. The new solution provides a full range of software testing, payment transaction validation, and user feedback services designed specifically for the Alexa platform and ecosystem. It is the industry’s first crowdtesting offering built for Amazon Alexa. Applause for Amazon Alexa is also nominated for a People’s Choice Award for Best New Product of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowdtesting leader won bronze in both the Marketing Campaign of the Year and the Company of the Year categories. The marketing efforts centered around Applause’s recent retail campaign. The campaign targeted the retail industry and featured a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:226510@1:url||https://www.applause.com/retail}&quot;&gt;microsite&lt;/a&gt; and Applause’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.applause.com/rs/539-CKP-074/images/2019-retail-quality-report.pdf&quot;&gt;2019 Retail Quality Report&lt;/a&gt;. The Company of the Year honor came as Applause was recognized for its continuous innovation and its focus on customer needs. In addition to launching new products and campaigns, Applause focused on its team and community, winning two awards for its commitment to the community from &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:7838@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/applause-receives-live-united-award}&quot;&gt;United Way&lt;/a&gt; and two others for workplace excellence from &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:897767@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/applause-a-boston-globe-top-place-to-work}&quot;&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:8482:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/boston-business-journal-best-place-to-work}&quot;&gt;Boston Business Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today released its new report highlighting the digital and omnichannel mistakes that plagued some of the world’s top retailers during the holiday season. The report, titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.applause.com/rs/539-CKP-074/images/2019-retail-quality-report.pdf&quot;&gt;The 2019 Retail Quality Report: Global Insights from the Holiday Shopping Season&lt;/a&gt;, provides retailers with six key recommendations and best practices to prepare for the 2019 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report leverages primary research from Applause’s industry-leading community of software testers and usability experts. Testing took place from Black Friday through December of 2018. Applause’s community completed functional and user experience testing on more than 50 top global retail ecommerce sites. In addition, the testers went through a specific omnichannel journey (buy online, return in store) in the US, UK, and Germany to compare the omnichannel experiences of each country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause identified more than 3,000 software bugs and UX issues, many of which impacted retail revenues during peak shopping periods. In fact, just 65 bugs cost retailers more than $60 million in holiday sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results show retailers aren’t doing enough to meet customer expectations, especially during key junctures of the holiday season,” said Kristin Simonini, VP of Product at Applause. “We see this as a global problem. Retailers aren’t designing digital experiences with customers in mind and the overall quality of these experiences is lacking. Learning from these mistakes and putting more emphasis on testing will help retailers prepare for peak periods this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other key findings from the report include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A single severe bug cost, on average, $915,240 when left in production for 14 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over half (53%) of all bugs found were classified as severe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication breakdowns threatened omnichannel experiences, and many shoppers weren’t able to find in-store areas to return items bought online&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most dangerous bugs were found in shopping carts, product pages, and account pages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdsourced testing&lt;/a&gt;, today announced it will receive the United Way Live United Award during tonight’s Shining Stars celebration. United Way of Tri-County is focusing on 10 impactful volunteer awards for the Shining Stars reception. This is the first year the charitable organization is hosting the Shining Stars reception and Applause is the only business being honored with a Live United award at the celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awards will be presented to local companies, volunteers, and donors for their contributions in raising awareness and understanding of the United Way mission, and for their efforts in volunteerism, outstanding dedication, service, leadership, and achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause is being recognized for its significant volunteer and fundraising efforts. Every year, Applause has dedicated to help its local community in partnership with United Way. In 2018, Applause donated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; • More than $10,000&lt;/strong&gt; in presents to local children as part of the Hope for the Holidays gift drive &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 273 pounds&lt;/strong&gt; of food during the Thanksgiving food drive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Resources and time&lt;/strong&gt; serving food on a quarterly basis at the Pearl Street Cupboard and Café&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 60 backpacks&lt;/strong&gt; filled with school supplies for the Tools for School program&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Time competing&lt;/strong&gt; in the corporate 5K fundraiser with 23 Applause team members in the race&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

By participating in activities with United Way, we not only improve our community, we strengthen our team and our company as a whole,” said Bradley Batchelder, VP of People &amp; Culture at Applause. “Our team members are always looking to lend a helping hand, and this award is a testament to their dedication and caring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award during the Shining Star reception will mark the second time in a one-year span United Way has recognized Applause for its commitment to community. In April, Applause received &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2442@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-honored-united-way-good-neighbor-award}&quot;&gt;United Way’s Good Neighbor Award&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, the worldwide leader in crowdsourced digital quality, has been named one of the Top Places to Work in Massachusetts in the 11th annual employee-based survey project from The Boston Globe. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://globe.com/topplaces&quot;&gt;Top Places to Work 2018&lt;/a&gt; issue is available online and in The Boston Globe Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boston Globe’s Top Places to Work program recognizes the most admired workplaces in the State of Massachusetts voted on by the people who know them the best—their employees. The survey measures employee opinions about their company’s direction, execution, connection, management, work, pay and benefits, and engagement. The employers are placed into one of four groups: small, with 50 to 99 employees; medium, with 100 to 249 workers; large, with 250 to 999; and largest, with 1,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This recognition from The Boston Globe further validates that we have a top-notch team at Applause,” said Bradley Batchelder, VP of People &amp; Culture at Applause. “Our mindset is all about collaboration, respect, and fun, and the team has embraced these values to the benefit of the company as a whole. This award is truly a testament to their hard work and dedication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Making employees happy doesn&#039;t have to take a lot of effort or money, but it does require companies to put workers first,&quot; said Katie Johnston, the Globe’s Top Places to Work editor. &quot;Our winning companies know that their people are their most valuable assets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rankings in the Top Places to Work are based on confidential survey information collected by Energage (formerly WorkplaceDynamics), an independent company specializing in employee engagement and retention, from more than 80,000 employees at 318 Massachusetts organizations. The winners share a few key traits, including offering progressive benefits, giving their employees a voice, and encouraging them to have some fun while they’re at it. Top Places to Work &lt;a href=&quot;https://globe.com/topplaces&quot;&gt;online extras&lt;/a&gt; include sortable rankings and photo galleries.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is recognizing Applause CEO and Founder Doron Reuveni as one of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs of 2018 at its Builders + Innovators Summit in Santa Barbara, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs selected Doron as one of 100 entrepreneurs from multiple industries to be honored at the three-day event. With more than 25 years&#039; experience, Doron is an internationally-recognized expert in software development and testing and the driving force behind one of the fastest growing tech companies in New England. Under Doron’s leadership, Applause became the worldwide leader in crowdsourced digital quality and was acquired by Vista Equity Partners, a top investment firm focused on software, data and technology-enabled businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Applause, Doron was the CEO and owner of Re.D Consulting, where he advised enterprise firms on their go-to-market strategies, company direction, and product roadmaps. He also served as SVP of Technology at Enigma, where he led multi-million dollar software implementations and managed a global team of professional software engineers, testers and project managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m honored to be recognized alongside all these innovative companies and entrepreneurs,” said Doron Reuveni. “Applause has had an incredible year of high growth. We’ve served thousands of customers like Google, FOX, the NFL and Amazon, expanded our solutions for voice recognition, AI and automation, and increased our community to more than 400,000 experts. This award is another testament to our success and I’m pleased that Applause is continuing to be recognized for delivering flawless digital experiences to the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A dynamic economy depends on dynamic entrepreneurs who disrupt industries and occasionally give birth to entirely new sectors,” said David M. Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs. “The purpose of Builders + Innovators is to support emerging leaders in their quests to innovate faster in order to grow their ideas. We are pleased to recognize Doron as one of the most intriguing entrepreneurs of 2018.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly 150 years, Goldman Sachs has been advising and financing entrepreneurs as they launch and grow their businesses. In addition to honoring 100 entrepreneurs, the summit consists of general sessions and clinics led by seasoned entrepreneurs, academics and business leaders as well as resident scholars.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Honored by Goldman Sachs for Entrepreneurship` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;Applause&lt;/a&gt;, the worldwide leader in crowdsourced digital quality, today announced that Liza Landsman, former president of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jet.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Jet.com&lt;/a&gt;, has been appointed to its board of directors, effective immediately. Landsman joins the board during a period of rapid advancement for Applause. Just one year since its acquisition by Vista Equity Partners, Applause has accelerated revenue growth and expanded its community to more than 400,000 software experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation is at the heart of this latest growth phase. Leading brands and enterprises rely on Applause crowd testing to ensure the quality of digital experiences for all consumers and users. Landsman’s appointment further establishes Applause as the number one destination for software testing in the digital economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m delighted to welcome Liza to our board,” said Doron Reuveni, CEO of Applause. “Jet.com was an early adopter of Applause and remains one of our long-standing customers. Liza has an impressive track record of leading companies through rapid growth as well as deep knowledge of how analytics can perfect digital and physical experiences across all channels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under her leadership at Jet.com, Landsman employed new brand engagement and quantitative marketing strategies that transformed the company from a startup to a $1 billion run-rate business. Prior to Jet.com, Landsman was chief marketing officer and a member of the executive committee at E*TRADE Financial, global head of digital for BlackRock, and a leader at both Citigroup and IBM. Today, Landsman is a venture partner at NEA and sits on the boards of two public companies, Veritiv Corporation (NYSE:VTRV) and Choice Hotels International (NYSE:CHH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m truly thrilled to be joining the Applause board,” said Landsman. “Crowd testing is a critical element to ensuring websites, apps, and in-store technologies meet customer expectations. At Jet.com, I witnessed first-hand how a large digital footprint and focus on quality affect company outcomes. I look forward to partnering with the Applause team to continue improving digital quality for companies worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landsman has received recognition for her outstanding leadership and expertise throughout her career, having been included on &lt;em&gt;Fortune’s&lt;/em&gt; Most Powerful Women “Ones to Watch” list, &lt;em&gt;Chain Store Age’s&lt;/em&gt; “Top 10 Women in Retail Tech,” and &lt;em&gt;Total Retail’s&lt;/em&gt; 2018 “Top Women in Retail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Liza’s public company experience will be invaluable as Applause continues its upward trajectory,” said Martin Taylor, operating principal at Vista Equity Partners and Director at Applause. “Her digital pedigree and extensive understanding of how users and customers interact with enterprises and brands through their digital assets will help Applause make further inroads with both chief digital and chief marketing officers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landsman’s board appointment reinforces Applause as a digital quality leader. In addition to strong revenue and customer growth, Applause is the first and only crowd testing provider listed in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Testing Services, Worldwide. With Landsman’s board membership and these latest accomplishments, Applause will continue to excel as the leader in crowd-sourced digital quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in crowd-sourced digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, announced today that prominent film director, producer, and YouTuber Casey Neistat will close out the first day of DigitalXChange ‘18, the company’s annual customer conference. As the premiere conference for digital quality and innovation, DigitalXChange draws technology leaders from top brands like CNN, Dow Jones, and Citi to highlight how they accelerate software velocity and improve quality – resulting in digital experiences that truly surpass customer expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before his YouTube fame, Neistat made his mark as an independent film and television commercial director, and starred in his own show with his brother on HBO. Eventually, Neistat combined his storytelling ability with his commercial expertise to attract a global audience of 10.2 million subscribers on his YouTube channel and re-define branded content with companies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ8RiLLt6yg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxfZkMm3wcg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;. Most recently, Neistat launched a new startup, 368, in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve spent my entire career pushing boundaries and finding what consumers really care about,” said Neistat. “With DigitalXChange, Applause is doing that very thing for technology companies by offering them a unique chance to attend an event that is both educational and experiential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neistat is DigitalXChange’s main keynote, joining Applause CEO Doron Reuveni, technologist &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2709@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/autodesk-fellow-tom-wujec-joins-dxc-keynotes}&quot;&gt;Tom Wujec&lt;/a&gt;, Forrester analyst Julie Ask, and Affectiva founder &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2712@1:url||https://www.applause.com/blog/rana-el-kaliouby-emotion-ai-dxc-mainstage}&quot;&gt;Rana el Kaliouby&lt;/a&gt;. The event will also feature discussions and customer stories about consumer app trends, crowd testing, test automation, digital payments, voice recognition, artificial intelligence (AI), and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Casey has an innate talent for helping people see the world from a new perspective,” said Charlie Ungashick, Applause CMO. “Applause brings this same vantage point to its customers – giving them insight into the experiences users truly have with their products in the real world. In the end, experience matters, and Casey is a great person to speak to that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the overwhelmingly positive feedback from last year’s event in San Francisco, Applause has expanded DigitalXChange to include an extra half a day to accommodate more of what attendees loved – keynotes, sessions, and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DigitalXChange ’18, occurring October 2 and 3 in Boston, offers the opportunity to network with industry peers and key decision makers from some of the world’s most innovative companies. Never before has digital experience presented so many opportunities for companies to touch their customers – from voice and artificial intelligence (AI) to app interactions to ordering online for store pick up. With real-world examples told by Applause customers, DigitalXChange will allow attendees to learn how to make the most of these powerful technology trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in crowd-sourced digital quality&lt;/a&gt;, officially announced today its annual conference, DigitalXChange, will be held in Boston on October 2-3, 2018.

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the worldwide leader in digital quality and crowdtesting&lt;/a&gt;, today announced the availability of &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:229678@1:url||https://www.applause.com/alexa-skills}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Applause for Amazon Alexa&lt;/a&gt;. The new solution provides a full range of software testing, payment transaction validation, and user feedback services designed specifically for the Alexa platform and ecosystem. Powered by a community of 300,000+ vetted testers worldwide, the new offering ensures product teams can dramatically increase quality and consumer adoption of their Alexa Skills and Alexa Voice Service (AVS) devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Alexa offers software developers a powerful platform for delivering meaningful, intuitive voice experiences to their users. Leading companies like Starbucks, Dow Jones, and Best Buy use Alexa to connect with consumers — allowing them to order online, get account information, check account balances, and more, all via voice interactions and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to build consumer-grade voice experiences, developers must consider a broad and complex set of variables — voice-enabled hardware, geolocation, languages and dialects, mobile apps, smart home devices and services, payments, and more. Testing for this complexity is critical in order to meet user expectations, and leveraging a global crowd of real-world testers is the best way to deliver high-quality software for voice applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause for Amazon Alexa provides benefits and capabilities that other approaches to software testing cannot match, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Wild Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; Rapidly measure the user experience for Alexa applications in any location – at home, in the office, in the car, or embedded in other devices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Voices:&lt;/strong&gt; Validate Alexa Utterance voice testing for different languages, dialects, genders, and age groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlimited Device Coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage 2.4 million real devices within the community, including thousands of testers who have their own Alexa-enabled hardware&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Diversity:&lt;/strong&gt; Incorporate Alexa best practices and certification requirements with a full range of testing, automation, accessibility, payment, and feedback services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SaaS Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; Extend development teams and test management by integrating bug tracking systems with the Applause Platform&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven Results with IoT:&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage Applause’s vast experience of testing with leading brands that build apps for Web, mobile, IoT, and voice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Voice and artificial intelligence platforms like Alexa are beginning to take off, but delivering great user experiences can be tricky,” said Charlie Ungashick, Head of Product at Applause. “Alexa Skills and devices must have predictable dialect interpretation, flawless connectivity and, of course, an intuitive user experience. The only way you can guarantee that your design will match reality is to test it in the wild, with real people, on real devices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in digital experience quality&lt;/a&gt;, announced today it received the United Way Tri-County Good Neighbor Award as recognition for its service to the 34 communities in Worcester, Middlesex, and Norfolk counties. The award comes as a result of Applause’s active participation in United Way charity initiatives throughout 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are dedicated to our community,” said Bradley Batchelder, VP of People &amp; Culture at Applause. “All team members get involved and this leads to a more unified company. Whether it’s donating time, money, or resources, members of Applause Nation are always willing to lend a helping hand and reach out to make somebody’s life better - in whatever way possible. This award is really a testament to the work of our employees and how much they care about their community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause participates in a number of charitable activities. Throughout the year, team members spend a few hours during the week serving food at the Pearl Street Café. The company also buys backpacks and fills them with school supplies every year as part of United Way’s annual backpack drive for underprivileged students in the area. During the holiday season, Applause team members continue their giving ways with the Thanksgiving food drive and the Hope for the Holidays gift drive in partnership with United Way Tri-County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To congratulate and thank the winners of the Good Neighbor Award, United Way of Tri-County hosted an event on April 5th, bringing all the winners together in one group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This event is all about them, our heroes,” said Paul Mina, United Way of Tri-County President and CEO. “We are truly honored to have the best supporters and volunteers, who stand with us and heroically take the action necessary to lift up our local communities and improve the quality of life for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Honored with United Way Good Neighbor Award` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in digital experience quality&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that Robert Mason has joined the company as Senior Vice President of Engineering. The addition comes just after Applause was recognized for its 186% growth rate on the &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2445@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-ranked-among-fastest-growing-companies}&quot;&gt;Deloitte Fast 500&lt;/a&gt;, and its ranking as a &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2444@1:url||https://www.applause.com/leader-in-crowdtesting-nelsonhall-applause}&quot;&gt;leader in crowdtesting&lt;/a&gt; by Nelson Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted to welcome Rob as a new executive presence on our team,” said Doron Reuveni, CEO of Applause. “Applause is poised for massive growth, particularly on the engineering and development front. Rob’s experience as a leader capable of juggling responsibilities, having simultaneously founded a company while working as its CTO and EVP of Engineering, will be invaluable to Applause as we continue to direct our efforts toward the enterprise. We’ve built a strong, industry-leading engineering team over the years, and Rob’s leadership will continue to push our team, and our product, to new levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mason joins Applause from Nasuni, an enterprise file services company, where he held various executive roles, including Founder, President, CTO and Executive Vice President of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to his leadership at Nasuni, Mason worked as the VP of Engineering at Archivas from 2004 to its acquisition by Hitachi in 2007, where he oversaw all development and quality assurance. After the Hitachi acquisition, he continued in his role as VP of HCAP Engineering, managing the integration of his team with Hitachi’s and supporting the broad rollout of HCAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is an exciting time to join Applause,” said Mason. “The company enters 2018 with high growth and a ton of momentum. I hope to harness this energy to bring an even more innovative focus to engineering and development moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mason has more than 20 years of operational, management and software development experience across many different companies, languages, platforms and technologies. He took Nasuni from initial product concept to over 10 Petabytes of managed storage consisting of billions of files in a global file system spanning more than 50 different countries. As Applause sets its sights on the enterprise, Mason will be an integral part of the company’s engineering success.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Bolsters Engineering Leadership with Robert Mason as SVP` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;global leader in digital experience quality&lt;/a&gt;, today announced a new user feedback solution to help companies increase conversions and brand loyalty. The Applause Customer Journeys solution delivers authentic user feedback for any type of digital or physical touch point – including apps, marketing materials, websites, in-store, IoT devices and more. It is the only solution that can reliably engage participants from any country to travel to a specific site, perform tasks, and supply assessments and analysis about their digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients can leverage the solution to gain insight into every stage of the software development lifecycle – from prototype to production. Through the Applause Platform, clients map customer journeys and demographic requirements, and deploy them to Applause’s global community of software digital experience experts. Using the all-new Applause mobile app, participants can easily register, find work, and get paid to complete journeys. The intuitive app guides users through tasks, providing key insights about the quality of their experience with the software. Clients can then view the journey feedback results to better understand how to provide the best digital experiences for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most successful companies are those that understand their customers, and build user feedback into their development processes,” said Charlie Ungashick, CMO of Applause. “It’s increasingly important for software teams to get real feedback from real human beings. Our new Customer Journeys solution is the first and only user feedback platform that goes anywhere customers go, and it’s backed by the world’s largest community of software experts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause Customer Journeys solution features the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applause Platform&lt;/strong&gt; – Software-as-a-service offering that provides an intuitive interface for clients to rapidly map and test customer journeys and consume the results in real-time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applause Mobile Apps&lt;/strong&gt; – Native Android and iOS apps for participants, which provide an easy way to view task instructions, answer survey questions, and add attachments like videos, narrated screen recordings, and screenshots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert Guidance&lt;/strong&gt; – User experience and usability researchers deliver advice, ensure insights are actionable, and assist with journey creation and analysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Communities&lt;/strong&gt; – Clients have the flexibility to leverage their own tester groups (such as employees, customers, etc.) or build target lists based on Applause’s community of more than 300,000 digital experts across more than 200 countries and territories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;Availability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause Customer Journeys solution is available immediately through a subscription, and the Applause mobile apps are available for participants in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in market insights, user feedback and digital testing&lt;/a&gt;, announced today that it will host its first annual DigitalXChange ’17 user conference, October 24, at the Park Central Hotel in San Francisco. The one-day event will feature visionary keynotes, real-world success stories and valuable networking with peers from leading companies. Attendees will get an inside look at the current and future leaders in digital experience along with the tools and best practices to ensure a successful brand in the digital world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top brands from around the world use Applause to deliver high-quality digital experiences to their customers. These businesses will bring their wealth of knowledge and expertise to DigitalXChange. Participating in panel discussions and individual speaking sessions, these organizations will explain how they build the digital properties that their customers demand with the intuitiveness they have come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Digital experience has become synonymous with customer experience,” said Charlie Ungashick, CMO for Applause. “Advances in technology have brought about new ways for brands and individuals to interact with each other. Consumers expect all facets of their brand experience to flow smoothly and seamlessly, regardless of the channel or platform they are using. This conference gives the world’s top brands a stage to engage and educate their peers on the advantages of communities to drive software innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses have realized they can no longer rely on traditional differentiators, and instead are focusing on customer experiences to make their solutions stand out. DigitalXChange will expand on this idea of customer-centricity, and attendees will learn about the latest mega-trends and their impact on business, consumerization and software design and development. Presentations will also provide insight on how companies can take testing from the lab to the real world to create an agile testing environment and improve software quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other topics that will be discussed at DigitalXChange include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best practices to drive software quality and agile development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Future application design trends, such as artificial intelligence, bots, virtual reality and augmented reality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real-world success stories in mobile and e-commerce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omni-channel customer experiences&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical and digital Internet of Things (IoT) software development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;` for post `Applause Announces DigitalXChange ’17, its First Annual User Conference` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that the company’s crowdtesting community has exceeded 300,000 members, further solidifying its lead as the largest professional QA and user experience testing community in the world. Applause also bolstered its executive team with seasoned technology leaders, Charlie Ungashick as CMO and Matt Engel as SVP of strategic development, and increased its West Coast presence by tripling the size of its Silicon Valley office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With thousands of customers – including 5 of Silicon Valley’s top 15 companies – Applause relocated and expanded its operations to support the significant demand from West Coast based enterprises and startups. The new office further advances Applause’s position to support global brands. Growth across all regions continues as the company has hired 125 people in the past 12 months and expects to double its staff in California, the UK, France, and Israel in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause customers benefit from access to digital experience experts who are physically located in the markets they serve – using real devices, real networks, and real data to perform real transactions. The company’s community of on-demand professionals, fully managed services, and real-time issue tracking platform all provide a unique advantage to customers, giving them actionable insight and feedback that no one else can match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These milestones are significant for the company. Our community of 300,000 digital experience experts provides the human perspective global brands need to deliver digital properties that customers embrace,” said Doron Reuveni, founder and chief executive officer of Applause. “You can’t hire, outsource or automate the increasingly converged digital-physical experience that defines real customer interaction, but you can replicate it with the crowdsourced approach provided by Applause.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Charlie Ungashick, Chief Marketing Officer -&lt;/strong&gt; With more than 20 years in the technology industry, Charlie was most recently chief marketing officer at Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC), a $1B global provider of technology platforms and solutions for engineering, business collaboration and the Internet of Things. Prior to joining PTC, Charlie was chief marketing officer at Globoforce, a SaaS company in the human capital management space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Matt Engel, Senior Vice President of Strategic Development -&lt;/strong&gt; Matt brings more than 15 years of experience with high growth technology companies, spanning early stages through IPO/M&amp;A. Prior to Applause, Matt was the CEO of venture-backed Attend, a SaaS marketing platform and Applause customer, and vice president of business development at Dyn, a cloud-based Internet performance management company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With 10 years in the industry, Applause still provides the only crowdsourced-approach that can deliver in-the-wild, enterprise-grade QA and usability results to customers,” said Sharon Wienbar, venture partner, Scale Venture Partners. “Today’s announcement is the perfect example of how they’ve kept their edge over the competition. Not only does Applause have the largest, fastest-growing community of digital experts in the world, it also has the enterprise-focused leadership and operational positioning to continue to meet the needs of its brand-named customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

<div class='progress-msg'>[22:37:27] - Custom field `_et_pb_old_content` will be updated with value `Applause Supports Upstream’s Mobile Commerce Platform to Provide High-Quality Digital Experiences for Consumers in Emerging Markets.

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it is working with the leading mobile commerce accelerator &lt;a href=&quot;https://upstreamsystems.com/&quot;&gt;Upstream&lt;/a&gt; to ensure valuable and user-friendly mobile experiences for consumers in emerging markets. Upstream leverages the Applause global community of more than 250,000 professional software testers to ensure high-quality, accurately-localized content is delivered by its customers to their consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2001, Upstream bridges the gap between content providers and consumers through its leading mobile commerce platform. The company helps mobile operators, service providers, developers and publishers capture the digital opportunity in developing markets across Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Upstream offers services that are localized, affordable, and easily accessible, regardless of network/device capabilities. Through these efforts, consumers are able to access content like mobile infotainment, stores/portals, education services, health services and micro-insurance services through SMS text, mobile web and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With solutions in place across more than 40 countries, Upstream’s growth has extended its reach, and led to requirements for testing under real-world conditions, not in a lab environment. Extreme variances in network connectivity and the numbers of different devices, carriers and operating systems presented challenges for in-house replication. To ensure that the end user experiences were up to the level of quality Upstream is known for, the company looked to Applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A large part of our value is to make sure the end users’ experience is flawless,” said Massimo del Vecchio, chief technology officer for Upstream. “Applause was the only vendor who could provide the breadth of testing coverage we needed across geographies, technologies, and business scenarios to ensure that high level of quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With local testers throughout South Africa, Nigeria, Brazil, Vietnam and the Philippines, an Applause Project Manager leads teams of testers in each location through both functional exploratory testing and test case execution on every single one of the digital properties on which operators rely on Upstream to deliver quality experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Upstream does amazing work and has incredible global reach, across over 40 high-growth markets,” said Mark Holland, vice president of delivery for Applause. “For a company with their scope and their reputation for excellence, our testers are responsible for ensuring the quality of their services are consistent with the perception of their brand. We thrive in situations like that and the results speak for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upstream has been able to perform quality assurance of services across more than 500 unique device/OS/carrier combinations with real people testing in all of the countries in which Upstream operates. Upstream runs upwards of 10-15 exploratory and test case driven test cycles each month through Applause, sometimes running dozens of test cycles in a single month to cover its various digital properties across the globe. The companies are continuing to help increase the value of Upstream to its current and potential content delivery partners worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Applause has sped up the process of reviewing and identifying issues for us,” added del Vecchio. “The end result is a higher quality experience that helps our mobile operator partners deliver even more value to consumers in high-growth markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;About Upstream&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences, has been selected as one of the 18 companies named to Gartner Inc.’s recently-published “Magic Quadrant for Application Testing Services, Worldwide.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is the only inclusion of a crowdtesting provider in this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gartner acknowledges the vastness of the market and the options available to companies. The report notes, “The application testing service market, with a copious number of providers, is fast-growing. Both full IT services providers and dedicated, pure-play application testing service providers coexist. Gartner is aware of about 300 companies in this market. This Magic Quadrant assesses 18 of the leading application service providers based on specified inclusion criteria.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe that being the only crowdsourced testing company in this report validates the approach we pioneered,” said Applause CEO Doron Reuveni. “With our global community we’re uniquely positioned to help companies understand how their digital presence is experienced by their users, be it via web or mobile app, in stores or on connected devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion in the Magic Quadrant came just weeks after Applause was listed in Gartner, Inc.’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.applause.com%2Fgartner-market-guide.html&amp;esheet=51494602&amp;newsitemid=20170117005360&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Market+Guide+for+Crowdsourced+Application+Testing+Services&amp;index=2&amp;md5=63e36f5e9eae1e3bbb3f533466afe6c7&quot;&gt;Market Guide for Crowdsourced Application Testing Services.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Applause is the largest, most complete crowdtesting company in the world with a reach and scale that others do not have,” added Reuveni. “We have thousands of customers, over 250,000 professional testers covering nearly 2.4 million real devices and we’re able to provide results nearly anywhere on the planet in a matter of hours. Our dedicated managed service approach sets us apart from others in the space. These capabilities are also why other global testing leaders like Accenture work with us to augment their own testing offerings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Magic Quadrant, Gartner assessed each provider on its ability to execute and its completeness of vision, using client references, background briefings, news releases and other analyst interactions as the basis for designating each provider’s position.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<div class='progress-msg'>[22:40:03] - Custom field `_et_pb_old_content` will be updated with value `Syús relies on applause testers to validate data and provide quality assurance for digital solutions that improve hospital efficiencies and increase access to patient care.

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syus.com/&quot;&gt;Syús&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;a leader in easy-to-use, data-powered software tools to improve the performance of surgical services,&lt;/strong&gt;has extended its partnership with Applause as part of its strategy and commitment to solution quality. Syús uses experts in data, digital technology, healthcare system processes and surgical environments from within Applause’s global community of more than 250,000 professional testers to make sure Syús solutions work as intended for their healthcare customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship means operating room surgical teams utilizing Syús solutions will continue to experience improved efficiencies with each release while simultaneously increasing satisfaction for both patients and staff. Applause program managers and testers work closely with the internal team at Syús to review data regarding doctor calendars, equipment availability and operating room schedules from disparate and sometimes proprietary systems to ensure the data accurately matches and synchronizes with the information underpinning the Syús scheduling and analytics platform. Syús solutions are transformative for surgical teams, executives and hospital staff with the power to improve the availability and quality of patient care. Solution quality assurance (QA) is a fundamental imperative and Applause is at the center of Syús’ QA process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Applause is a key part of what we do, working with them is like having a direct extension of our internal test team,” said &lt;strong&gt;Kevin O’Hara, CEO of Syús.&lt;/strong&gt; “Because they understand the real world and conditions where our customers work, they comprehend the context and critical nature of the decisions our customers make using our solution every day. Applause testing adds a layer of confidence to our ability to deliver high quality actionable digital solutions. We’re pleased to extend our partnership with them, because it’s ultimately operating room teams and patients who benefit from our highly accurate and reliable offerings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syús began as an internal effort to improve staffing efficiency at a leading anesthesia practice. Practice leaders and physicians believed staffing decisions for the OR ought to be driven by data and not anecdotal evidence alone. They developed patented data-driven tools to handle more cases in less time, and began to use these tools with their hospital partners. In 2011, Syús became an independent company to focus on meeting the needs of hospitals and health systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Successful technology providers understand that their solutions need to function in the real world under conditions that aren’t always ideal with users who don’t always behave the way their engineers planned,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause Vice President of Product Delivery, Chris Munroe.&lt;/strong&gt; “This is especially true for the solutions provided by Syús, for which the stakes are incredibly high. Syús is succeeding because it is listening to medical professionals, looking at the real data and providing solutions that make surgical teams more efficient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Working with Applause helps us deliver the highest quality versions of our solutions to surgical teams around the country,” added &lt;strong&gt;Laura Reynolds, VP or Operations for Syús.&lt;/strong&gt; “And the better our solutions, the better the results for patients. That’s what Applause helps Syús do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Syús&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission at Syús is simple: Deliver powerful, easy-to-use, data-powered tools to improve the performance of surgical services. At Syús, we believe the widespread adoption of electronic health record systems has been both a blessing and a curse. While hospitals now have vast amounts of data about all their surgical encounters, they often lack the tools to turn this data into actionable, easy-to-understand information. Existing tools are designed for IT professionals in multiple industries, are unnecessarily expensive and require teams and years to implement. It doesn’t have to be this way.

<div class='progress-msg'>[22:40:05] - Custom field `_et_pb_old_content` will be updated with value `Funding expedites the company’s expansion of its digital experience (dx) testing, feedback and research solutions

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, announced it has raised $35 Million in a Series F financing round. The largest new investor in this financing round was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.credit-suisse.com/global/en.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Credit Suisse&lt;/a&gt;, and the round also included an investment by strategic partner, Accenture. The funding will increase the company’s investment in its strategy as the go-to source for improving customers’ digital experiences. This round brings Applause’s total funding-to-date to more than $115 Million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the company formally launches its expanded Digital Experience solutions in the coming months, this funding enables Applause to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further expand its in-the-wild digital testing services.&lt;/strong&gt; The company will invest heavily in its real-world testing services that enable omni-channel testing – from web to mobile to IoT to brick &amp; mortar – on a global scale. The ability to test brands’ entire customer experience from virtual to physical worlds is already a selling point for Applause with large enterprises.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in growing its digital usability feedback services.&lt;/strong&gt; Applause will expand its usability and design feedback offerings – which are the company’s second largest revenue-producer today – enabling brands to rapidly collect and analyze feedback from crowdsourced user panels that demographically match customer’s end users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formally launch its digital research services.&lt;/strong&gt; In the past year, dozens of big brands have come to Applause seeking to conduct fast, effective, crowd-powered research to learn what their customers want – across the intersection of digital and physical experiences. And while Applause has successfully fulfilled those requests with its current capabilities, in order to scale to meet market demand anywhere around the globe, the company will invest heavily to expand technology development and extend access to multiple crowds and user panels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Digital experiences – from web to mobile to IoT to brick and mortar – are the epicenter of competition in many industries, including retail, restaurants, travel, banking, insurance and manufacturing. Late-stage funding from leaders like Credit Suisse and Accenture, enables us to double down on expanding our solutions,” said Applause CEO, Doron Reuveni. “Applause is uniquely positioned as the de facto leader in Digital Experience testing, usability feedback and research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The round had full participation from all of Applause’s previous investors, including Goldman Sachs’s Merchant Banking Division, QuestMark Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Longworth Venture Partners, Mesco Ltd and MassVentures. The company’s most recent funding was a $43 Million Series E round in January, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s funding news comes as brands are recognizing how critical their digital experiences are to their commercial success. And as the experience economy matures, these digital experiences are now the front door to brands, to the companies behind them, and to their top-line results. The ability to research, test, and get user feedback about your digital experience from people who mirror your end user base – and to do it in a rapid, agile manner – is a major competitive advantage for Applause customers like Amazon, Ralph Lauren, HBO, USA Today, BMW and Concur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our alliance with Applause and investment in the company is a powerful step forward in Accenture’s liquid workforce agenda,” said Paul Daugherty, chief technology officer, Accenture. “Combining our global testing capabilities with Applause’s ‘in-the-wild’ crowdtesting platform will provide clients with a better digital testing solution for websites, mobile apps and IoT products. Together, we bring a unique ability to scale to meet the demands of enterprise clients around the world. That is what led us to forge this alliance relationship and invest in Applause through Accenture Ventures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With global headquarters near Boston, MA, Applause launched in August of 2008. Company milestones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing its footprint to 300+ employees in Boston, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris and London&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing more than 100,000 new builds for 3,000 companies of all sizes – including Google, Microsoft, FOX, Rolex, Shutterfly, The American Red Cross and Runkeeper&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing its global community of professional testers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/articles/its-official-250000-utesters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;more than 250,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwired.com/press-release/utest-acquires-mobile-app-tool-company-apphance-in-seven-figure-deal-1690974.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of mobile SDK, Apphance in 2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2477@1:url||https://www.applause.com/utest-changes-name-to-applause-acquires-testhub}&quot;&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of EU crowdtesting leader, Testhub in 2014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dozens of awards, including wins from the &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2469@1:url||https://www.applause.com/american-business-awards-applause-gold-stevie-2015}&quot;&gt;Stevie Awards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2478@1:url||https://www.applause.com/forbes-names-utest-7th-most-promising-company}&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/articles/utest-labs-applause-named-gartner-cool-vendor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2457@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-makes-fifth-consecutive-inc-5000-list}&quot;&gt;Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;` for post `Applause Closes $35 Million F Round Led By Credit Suisse And Accenture` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that former PayPal executive, Rahul Shah, has joined Applause as Senior Vice President, Global Delivery &amp; Customer Success. The addition comes at a time when Applause has seen significant growth in its enterprise market, which includes helping many global brands deliver great digital experiences from &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:229107@1:url||https://www.applause.com/website-testing}&quot;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:229087@1:url||https://www.applause.com/mobile-app-testing}&quot;&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;/payment-testing&quot;&gt;payment strategy and validation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shah most recently led the Enterprise Technical Sales and Integration team at PayPal, where he was responsible for all technical aspects of selling, integrating and building long term value for merchants. He helped drive growth by implementing a Customer Success model based on a direct partnership with Sales and strong collaboration with Product, Engineering and Marketing that closely aligned with the expanding needs of PayPal’s merchant community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rahul is a recognized industry leader who excels in growth environments,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CEO Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “His expertise in the all-important payment technology space positions us well with retailers, restaurants, banks, insurance firms and travel companies – spaces where Applause has seen great enterprise adoption. Rahul will make our world-class delivery team even stronger as our customers ask us to tackle new challenges in digital testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to PayPal, Shah led the Technology Development and Customer Service organizations at a subsidiary of Allianz, where he served as the executive responsible for driving the company’s digitalization efforts. He previously spent 8 years at GE in various global leadership roles across Product, Marketing, Sales, and Strategy. He holds a Mechanical Engineering degree from UMass, Amherst and an MBA from Cal, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hire comes during a particularly busy summer for Applause: In June, the company aggressively expanded its presence in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com/de&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com/fr&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and Spain; in August, Applause announced its global community of professional testers surpassed the 250,000 member mark; the company has also received numerous technology awards including a &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2460@1:url||https://www.applause.com/applause-wins-siia-award}&quot;&gt;CODiE Award&lt;/a&gt; and both domestic and international Stevie Awards for its Test Automation offering and just last week, the company made its fifth consecutive Inc.

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, made its fifth-straight Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies, coming in at number 1763. The list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy’s most dynamic segment— its independent small businesses. Companies such as Microsoft, Dell, Domino’s Pizza, Pandora, Timberland, LinkedIn, Yelp, Zillow, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees of the Inc. 5000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the five years we’ve appeared on the Inc. 5000 list, Applause has grown to the point where we now work with the world’s most recognized brands in retail, media, fitness and banking,” said &lt;strong&gt;Doron Reuveni, CEO of Applause.&lt;/strong&gt; “Even though our client base and company size have expanded, we are still seeing startup levels of topline growth. This fifth straight appearance on Inc.’s list is a validation of the value that our digital testing provides to companies – from emerging startups to global enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2016 Inc. 5000, unveiled online at Inc.com and with the top 500 companies featured in the September issue of Inc. (available on newsstands August 23) is the most competitive crop in the list’s history. The average company on the list achieved a mind-boggling three-year growth of 433%. The Inc. 5000’s aggregate revenue is $200 billion, and the companies on the list collectively generated 640,000 jobs over the past three years, or about 8% of all jobs created in the entire economy during that period. Complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/inc5000&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;www.inc.com/inc5000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Inc. 5000 list stands out where it really counts,” says &lt;strong&gt;Inc. President and Editor-In-Chief Eric Schurenberg&lt;/strong&gt;. “It honors real achievement by a founder or a team of them. No one makes the Inc. 5000 without building something great – usually from scratch. That’s one of the hardest things to do in business, as every company founder knows. But without it, free enterprise fails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth consecutive appearance on the Inc. 5000 list is the latest major achievement in a string of accolades and milestones for Applause. &lt;strong&gt;The company also announced today that its global community of professional software testers – the largest such group in the world – surpassed the 250,000 member mark.&lt;/strong&gt; Applause was also recently awarded a 2016 SIIA CODiE Award for its Mobile Beta Management offering. It also won both a 2016 International Business AwardSM and an American Business Awards for its Test Automation Offering. Applause Test Automation has also been named a finalist in the Mobile category for the MASSTLC Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applause,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, has been named the winner of a Silver Stevie® Award for “Best New Product or Service of the Year” for its Test Automation offering in the 13th Annual International Business Awards today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Business Awards are the world’s premier business awards program. All individuals and organizations worldwide – public and private, for-profit and non-profit, large and small – are eligible to submit nominations. The 2016 IBAs received entries from more than 60 nations and territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicknamed the Stevies for the Greek word for “crowned,” the awards will be presented to winners at a gala awards banquet at the Rome Cavalieri Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Rome, Italy on 21 October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A record total of more than 3,800 nominations from organizations of all sizes and in virtually every industry were submitted this year for consideration in a wide range of categories, including Company of the Year, Marketing Campaign of the Year, Best New Product or Service of the Year, Startup of the Year, Corporate Social Responsibility Program of the Year, and Executive of the Year, among others. Applause won in the Best New Product or Service of the Year in Software for Mobile Development Solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re honored to win our eighth Stevie Award for our Test Automation solution,” said &lt;strong&gt;Jan Wolter, VP and GM of Applause EU&lt;/strong&gt;. “It’s important to us that we deliver the best solutions to our clients that enable them to better help their own customers, wherever in the world they may be. Applause Test Automation was recognized because it delivers a clear ROI much faster than traditional automation solutions and allows brands to leverage the expertise within our vast community of professional testers. We’re grateful to the judges for recognizing our innovative approach to test automation. Congratulations to all the other winners and nominees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevie Award winners were determined by the average scores of more than 200 executives worldwide who participated in the judging process from May through early August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This year’s IBA judges were treated to many remarkable and inspiring stories of achievement around the world,” said Michael Gallagher, president and founder of the Stevie Awards. “We look forward to sharing many of these stories with people around the world over the coming months, through the Stevie Awards blog and social media channels, with the hope that they will inspire and instruct the next generation of business achievers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that it is extending its partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breezeworks.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Breezeworks™&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;the leading all-in-one business management solution for independent service businesses.&lt;/strong&gt; Breezeworks will continue to leverage the Applause global community of more than 200,000 professional software testers to help ensure high-quality, reliable, digital experiences for Breezeworks users. The extended relationship helps ensure that Breezeworks users around the world will continue to have great experiences utilizing the technology to organize billing and scheduling, and maintain relationships with internal teams and customers, all without costly increases in overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the continued partnership, members of the Applause global testing community will continue to work with the internal team at Breezeworks on test case execution for the Breezeworks iOS and Android mobile applications. Utilizing the Applause community, Breezeworks is able to maintain a rigorous internal QA schedule and can scale tester resources on demand. This enables Breezeworks’ internal team to concentrate on improvements to its already top-of-class apps and understand how those apps are going to perform in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Applause is such a key part of what we do, working with them is like having a direct extension of our internal test team,” said &lt;strong&gt;Matthew Cowan, CEO of Breezeworks.&lt;/strong&gt; “Because they test our apps in the real world with real users, they help us make sure our customers are satisfied, no matter where they are. Much like we help independent business owners feel confident with billing and scheduling, Applause makes us feel confident our digital experiences are of the highest quality for our users. We’re thrilled to be extending our partnership with them, because it’s Breezeworks users who will benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breadth of Breezeworks features and functions touches on every aspect of field service management operations: intuitive and simple-to-use tools for job scheduling, team management via smartphone or the larger screen real-state of a web client, paperless invoicing and estimates, on-site credit card or check payment processing, automated customer updates and follow-up and native QuickBooks bookkeeping software integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To achieve digital success, brands need to listen to their users, because those are the ones who are engaging with the app under real-world conditions,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause Co-Founder and Vice President of Product Management, Roy Solomon.&lt;/strong&gt; “This is especially true for an app like Breezeworks, which itself helps field service businesses organize and serve their customers. Breezeworks is succeeding and that is because their entire team understands the importance of listening to their users and not just meeting those needs but anticipating their wishes and meeting those expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Working with Applause enabled us to get the best quality versions of our app to market faster than we otherwise would have,” added Cowan. “And the quicker we get new versions to market, the more independent businesses we can help succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;About Breezeworks - Work Smarter on the Go&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breezeworks™ gives independent service professionals the ability to seamlessly manage onsite teams, improve customer experience and streamline payment processes, without the overhead. The Breezeworks applications, available both on the web and on smartphones, support businesses on the go. The app makes it a breeze to schedule appointments, manage jobs, collect payments, eliminate no shows, navigate traffic, capture repeat business, follow up with customers and connect with suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breezeworks was founded by veteran technologists Matthew Cowan (Intel, CNET, iVillage, Geocities) and Adam Block (IDG, Harmonic Communications), and is backed by prominent investors including Obvious Ventures, Harmony Partners; and angel investors Marc Benioff, Max Levchin, James Murdoch, David Sacks, Peter Thiel, and Jeff Skoll.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Extends Partnership With Breezeworks™ To Provide High Quality Digital Experiences For Independent Service Businesses` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that it is extending its partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://passportinc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Passport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;the industry-leading provider in mobile payments for parking and transit,&lt;/strong&gt; to continue to offer the best user experience at all of the company’s installations across North America. Passport leverages the Applause global community of more than 200,000 professional software testers as part of a multi-tiered approach to ensure high-quality, fast and accurate experiences for users. Applause works with Passport to routinely test the Passport app to ensure the app works as intended in the cities where the company is offering or intends to offer parking, citation and transit solutions. The companies will continue to work together on new builds and continuous releases as it sees increased adoption across new municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Passport, drivers pay for on and off street parking through the mobile app on their smartphone – no more feeding coins to meters. The Charlotte, NC- based mobile payments provider has successfully launched its industry-leading mobile payment solution in cities like Chicago, Boston, Toronto, and Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At Passport, we’re committed to developing exceptional applications for our customers to help them get where they are going quickly,” said &lt;strong&gt;Passport Chief Technology Officer, Brad Powers.&lt;/strong&gt; “We utilize a variety of best-in-class internal processes as well as the testing we do with Applause in order to deliver the best app experience for our users. We know our app works in our parking lot, but we need to make sure it also works in the multi-level city parking lot under a bridge, near the river in Toronto. Applause tests our app when and wherever we need them to, so we know it will work well across various devices and configurations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has also expanded its reach in mobile parking payment installations to include private parking operators, doctor’s office locations, universities, restaurants, and retail centers. Passport’s solutions are available in over 100 municipalities across North America, and other parking environments have taken interest in the company’s enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passport utilizes a multi-tiered development and QA process that includes internal testing, automated testing, and going above and beyond with additional technology solutions. Applause works with the Passport team, testing the app to make sure it works as intended in the hands of users not just in different cities, but also in specific lots and locations. With professional testers in more than 200 countries and territories around the world, Applause is able to scale up the number of testers quickly in the locations Passport needs in order to identify issues prior to launching the app. The Passport team has employed a multi-faceted approach to make sure their app is of the highest quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To achieve digital success, brands need to listen to their users, because those are the ones who are engaging with the app under real-world conditions,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CMO/CSO, Matt Johnston.&lt;/strong&gt; “This is especially true for an app like Passport. The entire Passport team cares about their users and they know the importance of making sure their parking and transit solutions work the way they need to for the millions of people looking for parking and other transit solutions in specific locations around the country. The Passport team works to make sure their users have a great experience with their app and that their commercial and municipal customers can have confidence in the solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Working with Applause enabled us to get the best quality app to market faster than we otherwise would have,” added Powers. “And the quicker we get to market, the more cities we can help solve the parking and transit issues that affect the daily lives of their residents and commuters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In today’s apps economy, it’s the users who determine quality, so it makes sense to include them in development and QA” said &lt;strong&gt;Roy Solomon, Co-Founder and Vice President of Product Management for Applause.&lt;/strong&gt; “Our Mobile Beta Management offering provides companies of all size with enterprise-grade insight into how their app performs in the hands of users before launch. That knowledge can be the difference between an app that goes nowhere and one that earns loyal fans and beats the competition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that it has extended its partnership with the &lt;strong&gt;American Red Cross,&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that their full suite of highly rated mobile apps and now their ‘Take a Class’ section of their signature public website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcross.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;RedCross.org&lt;/a&gt;, are reliable when people need vital information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Cross is widely known as a disaster relief and training agency. What people may not know is that they are also digital innovators, with a highly-rated website and collection of mobile apps that expand their capacity and efficiencies in providing services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Working with Applause is one important way that we are innovating to make sure that the Red Cross continues to be the standard bearer for serving people in need and those who want to help them,” said &lt;strong&gt;Dominick Tolli, Vice President, Product Management and Development at the Red Cross.&lt;/strong&gt; “Whether they are receiving a warning about a pending disaster or registering for training, people who use our mobile apps and website expect a glitch-free experience that works as they want and need it to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For us, working with the Red Cross is about more than helping them provide great apps,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CEO Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “More and more, people are looking for what they need in this world through digital interaction. And when people are engaging with the Red Cross, they’re looking for instruction, asking for help or trying to offer help. Making that experience better – an experience that can save lives – is the ultimate validation of our in-the-wild testing approach to make sure apps and websites work in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this partnership, the Red Cross has access to testers from Applause’s community of 200,000+ professional software testers in 200+ countries and territories. Applause provides multiple types of testing for the Red Cross, including functional testing of mobile apps and customized usability testing for course registration, general usability and check-out processes for the ‘Take a Class’ section of their website. Applause also runs vital load testing for the Red Cross, which has helped ensure Red Cross apps are able to handle the increased usage that comes when providing relief to scores of people dealing with natural disasters like floods, hurricanes and tornadoes. The organization’s signature First Aid App has undergone thorough testing (both functional and usability) to make sure that it is easy to understand, even if a person has not had Red Cross training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its First Aid and emergency preparedness apps, the Red Cross is able to reach millions of people who otherwise may not be prepared to deal with emergencies or able to take advantage of their services. The award-winning apps have been used to save lives by alerting people that they need to take cover in a safe place due to severe weather conditions. The expert advice in the First Aid App has been used by people who have been in situations where someone was bleeding, choking, having a heart attack and experiencing a seizure. Applause currently tests Red Cross digital apps using 250 testers in the U.S., Caribbean and other international locations where the organization operates.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Helps American Red Cross Become Digital Leader In Emergency Preparedness` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today formally announced Michael Weinberg as its General Manager for all of its operations in Israel. The addition comes as part of the company’s expanded presence and increased investment in Israel, and also as the company’s suite of digital quality tools and services – including its core In-the-Wild Testing Services and Applause Test Automation – have seen accelerated adoption by Israeli companies in recent quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From leadership positions in the Israel’s Intelligence Corps’ Computing unit, through building a new business for Merrill Lynch with a strong technological infrastructure, to founding and growing a Consumer Internet startup company (Wizpert), Weinberg has extensive experience as he joins the Applause global leadership team. He holds a law degree from Bar Ilan University in Israel, and has earned an MBA from Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m ecstatic to have Michael take the reins as we make a direct investment in our Israeli presence,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CEO and Israeli native Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “Adding someone with his diverse technology and business experience is a byproduct of our company’s growth and success in Israel and increased adoption of our value. Israeli brands understand the need to focus on their digital customers’ definition of quality, and we are the ones with the tools and services to help them do just that. Michael’s arrival fortifies us for the continuing steep growth and market adoption our technology is forecast to achieve - in Israel and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hire is the most prominent move in the company’s first direct investment in Israel after partnering closely for the past six years. The company also completed an acqui-hire of several employees from its strategic partner, and will extend its physical &amp; digital presence in Israel in the coming months. Applause plans to have 20 employees in Israel by the end of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Israel has proven to be a strategically important market, and was one of the growth engines that helped Applause get to where it is today,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause co-founder and Israeli native Roy Solomon.&lt;/strong&gt; “We’ve seen great adoption of our app quality tools and services, and - much like our investment in the EU where we saw a 400% increase in staff our first two years - we want to continue to invest and educate the market here on the importance of 360 degree app quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hire is also the latest news in what has been a headline-filled 18-month span for the app quality company. In late spring of 2014, the company announced an expanded vision and changed its name from uTest to Applause. At the same time, the company spun off a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;new, tester-centric uTest&lt;/a&gt; which itself relaunched late fall as a professional network for QA and QE professionals. Applause also made its formal entry into the EU with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/05/applause-buys-testhub/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;major acquisition of leading German crowdtesting company, Testhub&lt;/a&gt; (which became Applause EU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has seen steep growth and added to its collection of accolades. In February of 2015, the company was named to its 3rd consecutive list of Most Promising Companies in America by Forbes Magazine. In June, the company won its 5th American Business Award, this one for &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2469@1:url||https://www.applause.com/american-business-awards-applause-gold-stevie-2015}&quot;&gt;“Most Innovative Company - up to 2500 employees”&lt;/a&gt; Then, in August, the company was named to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/profile/applause&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;4th consecutive placing in the top 25%&lt;/a&gt; of the Inc. 5000.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Announces Addition Of Michael Weinberg As General Manager Of Applause Israel` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that it is partnering with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.messageloud.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;messageLOUD&lt;/a&gt;, the mobile text-reading service that reads messages and email aloud,&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that messageLOUD works under real-world conditions and keeps drivers who need to take incoming messages, safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;messageLOUD utilizes software testers from Applause’s global community to ensure high-quality, accurate messageLOUD experiences in multiple countries around the world. For messageLOUD’s launch, Applause provided program management and testers in specific locations across the USA, UK and South Africa. The testers used messageLOUD on their own smart phones, in their own vehicles, traveling on busy streets and highways to put the app through its paces and identify issues. The companies will continue to work together on new builds and continuous releases of messageLOUD across new geographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By working with Applause, we have been able to make sure critical issues were found and resolved before release,” said &lt;strong&gt;Garin Toren, CEO of messageLOUD.&lt;/strong&gt; “Distracted driving kills thousands and injures more than half a million people each year in North America alone. Our mission at messageLOUD is to eliminate accidents and deaths due to smartphone usage while driving. And Applause, with their global community of professional testers, is uniquely-positioned to help us make sure our app works the way it is supposed to in the real world. Not in a QA lab, but in actual vehicles where our app can be the difference between life and death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texting while driving is now the leading cause of death for teens in the United States. Yet, at any given hour across America, approximately 660,000 drivers are using smartphones while driving. Despite the fact that 45 states have made texting and emailing while driving illegal, it’s clear people are actively using their phones. According to a distracted driving study conducted this year by the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction, 70% percent of drivers admit they use their smartphones while they are driving. According to the study, 61% of people admit to texting and 33% read and send emails while they are behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;messageLOUD is designed to combat this national, distracted driving pandemic with a singular focus on consumer safety. messageLOUD automatically reads texts and email out loud so people can put their phones down and drive safe while using an innovative technique for eyes-free response and interaction. messageLOUD uses the full screen on your smart phone as the user interface which allows only simple screen swipes (up, down, double-tap) to execute a concise set of interactions. Users can also set up auto responders and use settings to tailor which messages they want to be read out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause works with the messageLOUD QA team running weekly test sprints to ensure the app is problem-free. With professional testers in more than 200 countries and territories around the world, Applause was able to scale up the number of testers quickly in both the U.S. and internationally in order to identify issues prior to launching the app. While the messageLOUD in-house team found over 80 bugs internally, the Applause testers put the app through its paces in the wild under real-world conditions and found an additional 100 bugs over a 6 week period, which enabled the messageLOUD team to address critical issues before its initial release on December 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To achieve digital success, it’s vital that brands listen to their users, and recognize that those users define app quality and decide which brands win or lose,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CMO/CSO, Matt Johnston.&lt;/strong&gt; “But for Applause, working with messageLOUD is about more than creating great apps or brand loyalty. It’s about testing and improving an innovative technology that is saving lives. It’s the ultimate validation of our in-the-wild testing approach and ensuring that mobile apps work in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Working with Applause enabled us to make rapid improvements and get to market faster than we otherwise would have,” added Toren. “And the quicker we get to market with new builds of our app means more people downloading it and using it. And that can save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;messageLOUD is available for download at the Google Play Store, with an iPhone app to follow soon. A discounted yearly subscription to messageLOUD is also available from messageLOUD’s website enabling gifting to family, friends or your employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;About messageLOUD&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;messageLOUD is a patent pending messaging service that automatically reads your texts and email out loud, allowing you to drive, work and play safely and productively. Our mission is to eliminate distracted driving with an eyes-free experience that enables you to automatically hear your messages out loud, to easily delete or dismiss messages, or call the sender back –– all without having to look at your phone.

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today formally announced Thom Kenney as its new Chief Technology Officer. The addition comes as the company’s suite of digital quality tools and services – including Applause Test Automation and Mobile Beta Management – have seen accelerated adoption by enterprise companies in recent quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software leader with more than 20 years of technology experience, Kenney leads the company’s global efforts across product, engineering and DevOps. Prior to Applause, Thom was VP of Global Engineering for LogMeIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seasoned engineer with wide-reaching experience, Kenney has been a recipient of numerous awards, including distinguished military honors from multiple combat deployments overseas. He holds an MBA from the University of Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m ecstatic, not only to have Thom join the Applause team, but also for the reasons we added him,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CEO Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “Adding someone of his level with such extensive enterprise-focused experience is a byproduct of our company’s growth and success. Our app quality offerings – and our ability to take those offerings to market – are maturing. Thom’s arrival fortifies us for the steep growth and market adoption our solutions are forecast to achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hire is the latest news in what has been a headline-filled 18-month span for the app quality company. In late spring of 2014, the company announced an expanded vision and changed its name from uTest to Applause. At the same time, the company spun off a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;new, tester-centric uTest&lt;/a&gt; which itself relaunched late fall as a professional network for QA and QE professionals. Applause also made its formal entry into the EU with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/05/applause-buys-testhub/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;major acquisition of leading German crowdtesting company, Testhub&lt;/a&gt; (which became Applause EU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has seen steep growth and added to its collection of accolades. In February of 2015, the company was named to its 3rd consecutive list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/most-promising-companies/list/#tab:rank&quot;&gt;Most Promising Companies in America&lt;/a&gt; by Forbes Magazine. In June, the company won its 5th American Business Award, this one for &lt;a href=&quot;{entry:2469@1:url||https://www.applause.com/american-business-awards-applause-gold-stevie-2015}&quot;&gt;“Most Innovative Company - up to 2500 employees”&lt;/a&gt; Then, in August, the company was named to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/profile/applause&quot;&gt;4th consecutive placing in the top 25% of the Inc. 5000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Announces Addition Of Thom Kenney To Its Executive Team As CTO` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;uTest&lt;/a&gt;, the global community for software testers, today announced the launch of its professional network geared exclusively for individuals in the QA and QE space. This new hub creates a place for novice and veteran testers alike to receive free training, create and consume tailored content, find paid testing projects, and connect with peers. The uTest community is already the world’s largest, with more than 200,000 testers from 200+ countries and territories around the world, and aims to include millions of testers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uTest first launched in 2008, with the parent company changing its name to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;Applause&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2014. At that point in time, the uTest brand was re-focused to best serve the large community of testers the company had built up since launch, and whose professional needs were going largely unmet. Today’s re-launch of uTest takes that mission much further, creating the world’s first professional network for anyone in the broader software quality space – including automation engineers, security specialists, usability experts and QA professionals. With the launch, uTest community members will continue to be eligible to be invited to paid testing cycles for Applause, with top testers earning tens of thousands of dollars each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For too long, individuals in testing &amp; QA departments have been woefully underserved – always the last in line, and often underappreciated.” said &lt;strong&gt;Matt Johnston, Chief Strategy Officer for Applause and uTest.&lt;/strong&gt; “With today’s announcement, we’re raising the bar for those companies that claim they care about testers and the QA profession. uTest is the hub for testers to get what they need to ace their current job, prepare for and find their next job and build their professional network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features of the new uTest include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paid Projects:&lt;/strong&gt; A listing of paid opportunities from Applause, to which uTest community members can apply. Projects include testing for amazing brands like Google, Netflix, Amazon, BMW and RunKeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Reputation:&lt;/strong&gt; Community members earn “uPoints” and badges through paid work and by creating or consuming content like articles, courses and reviews of testing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courses:&lt;/strong&gt; uTest University provides free educational and coaching resources for testers, with courses about modern topics like testing Android apps, responsive web design, IoT, and test automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion Forums:&lt;/strong&gt; Real-time discussions with peers on topics including career advice, “how-to” advice, tech trends, as well as lighter subjects, such as contests, polls and giveaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool Reviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Ratings and reviews of software testing tools to help individuals select the right QA- or QE-related products. This is also a great way for test tool vendors to connect directly with their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry Events:&lt;/strong&gt; A great way for tools and events companies to promote their events, meetups and webinars. Community members can submit their own, find events of interest, and even keep track of upcoming events by adding them to their calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revamped uTest site is another example of the company’s continued investment in the broader QA and QE profession. It also represents an evolution in the professional networking space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adds Johnston, “Increasingly, people want to engage in more tailored, meaningful ways with others who do the same type of work. This new professional network enables testers to expand and share their knowledge with peers in a way that is both good for their career and good for the testing craft.”&lt;/p&gt;` for post `uTest Launches Professional Network Designed Specifically For Software Testers` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;was presented with a Gold Stevie® Award in the Most Innovative Company (Up To 2,500 Employees)&lt;/strong&gt; category in the 13th Annual American Business Awards in Chicago last night. The win marks the sixth Stevie® Award for Applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stevieawards.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;The American Business Awards&lt;/a&gt; are the nation’s premier business awards program. All organizations operating in the U.S.A. are eligible to submit nominations – public and private, for-profit and non-profit, large and small. More than 3,300 nominations from organizations of all sizes and in virtually every industry were submitted this year for consideration in a wide range of categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an incredible honor and a strong validation that we are ahead of the curve in our approach to app quality,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CEO Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “Companies can no longer view their app quality in a vacuum. They must approach it holistically and ensure their apps work as intended in the hands of users. Our model has earned us thousands of customers, helped us grow into a global app quality leader, and garnered us this recognition from the American Business Awards. We’re thankful to all of the judges for their consideration. We’ll keep innovating and we hope to be a contender again next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicknamed the Stevies for the Greek word meaning “crowned,” the awards were presented to winners during a gala banquet on Monday, June 22 at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel. More than 400 nominees and their guests attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are extremely impressed with the quality of the entries we received this year. The competition was intense and every organization that won should be proud,” added Michael Gallagher, president and founder of the Stevie Awards. “To those outstanding individuals and organizations that received Gold, Silver, and Bronze Stevie Awards, the judges and I are honored to celebrate your many accomplishments. You are setting a high standard for professionals nationwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award win is the latest news in what has been a milestone-filled eighteen months for Applause. The company announced it received a $43MM E-Round, led by Goldman Sachs and announced its expanded app quality offering, rebranding from uTest to Applause. The company also made its entry into the EU with a major acquisition of top EU crowdtesting company, testhub (which became Applause EU). Applause recently launched ARC - a free publication dedicated to providing expert analysis, information and research on every aspect of today’s apps economy. In addition to multiple Stevie Award wins the past two years, Applause has also made three straight appearances on both the INC 5000 and Forbes’ list of America’s Most Promising Companies. Just last month, the company added Test Automation to its suite of app quality offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015 American Business Awards will be presented at two awards events: Monday’s banquet in Chicago, and at the new products awards banquet on Friday, September 11 in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 200 executives worldwide participated in the judging process to select this year’s Stevie Award winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;About the Stevie Awards&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevie Awards are conferred in six programs: the Asia-Pacific Stevie Awards, the German Stevie Awards, The American Business Awards, The International Business Awards, the Stevie Awards for Women in Business, and the Stevie Awards for Sales &amp; Customer Service. Stevie Awards competitions receive more than 10,000 entries each year from organizations in more than 60 nations. Honoring organizations of all types and sizes and the people behind them, the Stevies recognize outstanding performances in the workplace worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Honored As Gold Stevie® Award Winner At The 2015 American Business Awards` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today announced a major new addition to its suite of app quality tools and services - Applause Test Automation. With this new offering, Applause customers can now fulfill their entire app testing portfolio with the app quality company – from manual to automated testing for web, mobile and wearable apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before today’s launch, companies seeking to automate their testing faced long-term, big-money contracts with a vendor of proprietary tools and/or device access. On top of that, companies still had to create automation scripts and maintain them as their apps change. Because of this, a majority of the costs often occurred after companies had licensed the software and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new Applause turnkey solution, companies can now get the software tools, the device access and the expert services to build and maintain a best-in-class automation solution. Applause customers simply detail their desired test scenarios, and Applause takes it from there, providing what competitors can’t, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-stop shopping –&lt;/strong&gt; Applause provides the automation framework, scripts, software, devices (shared device cloud, private device cloud, or on-premise devices) and a team of automation experts to create, maintain and adapt a custom automation solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single automation solution –&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than having one set of tools for web apps, and another solution for mobile apps, and still another for wearables, Applause Test Automation supports a full range of browser-based and native applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freedom –&lt;/strong&gt; After Applause creates the scripts and abstraction layer, the customer owns them. There is no lock-in to closed or proprietary technology, and no onerous long-term contractual commitments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster implementation –&lt;/strong&gt; Companies can sign up, provide their test automation goals within days, and see positive ROI in weeks – rather than the customary payback period of years (or all too often, never).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Applause long ago established itself as the global leader in testing apps on real devices under real world conditions. Now – with the help of hundreds of customers who have shared their perspectives and pain points – we’re reinventing the modern test automation landscape,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CEO Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “In today’s increasingly agile apps economy, companies’ testing efforts must be able to keep up with the pace of engineering and dev ops. Now, Applause customers can do that in many different ways. We’re further establishing ourselves as the preferred partner for all our customers’ app quality needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework for Applause Test Automation extends the capabilities of popular open source tools (Appium, TestNG and Selenium), enabling the Applause automation engineers to evolve scripts more quickly and keep up with the pace of change in a company’s apps. Also, tests can be run on iOS, Android and web from the same framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed features of Applause Test Automation include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Case Writing:&lt;/strong&gt; Applause works with companies to create custom test scenarios that represent real-world user experiences. Applause test case writers create the manual test cases or modify existing scenarios to ensure they can be automated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Script Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Applause automation engineers develop automated scripts and custom object layer, resulting in an automation implementation that’s quick to deploy and easy to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Script Maintenance and Execution:&lt;/strong&gt; Even small application changes can require changes to automation scripts. With Applause, automation script failures are reviewed and corrected by members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;global Applause QA community&lt;/a&gt;, and we notify immediately if any bugs are discovered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Devices in the Cloud:&lt;/strong&gt; The Applause device clouds, created in collaboration with Testdroid, provide and maintain the infrastructure in the US and in the EU, so customers don’t have any incremental investment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation Team:&lt;/strong&gt; A full team of Applause automation engineers and test case creators, responsible for all technical aspects of the project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the latest major announcement for Applause, which is a finalist for a 2015 Stevie Award for Most Innovative Company, and which launched Applause EU in Germany last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause Test Automation joins in-the-wild testing, mobile beta management and mobile app analytics in the company’s 360° suite of app quality tools and services.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Announces Test Automation Solution For Mobile, Wearable And Web Apps` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;RunKeeper and Waze have been named the grand-prize winners in the first-ever Ovation Awards – winning the “Standing Ovation” awards for App of Year for Android and iOS respectively. The apps top a list that also includes Spotify, Evernote and Flipboard, which were all winners for best app in their OS and category in the awards’ inaugural year. The Ovation Awards were created by Applause to celebrate app quality as defined by the people who matter most – the ones who live, breathe and, most importantly, use apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;DETERMINING THE WINNERS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched on November 12, 2014, the Ovation Awards determined the winners in three stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting the 200 Finalists - To accurately measure user sentiment in order to narrow down millions of apps to a field of 200 finalists, a team of Applause analysts and data scientists utilized the mountain of data that fuels Applause Analytics (number of reviews, Applause score to measure user sentiment, et al). The team combined this information with additional data sources to gauge each app’s popularity and impact on the apps ecosystem to come up with a proprietary algorithm that determined the field of finalists. For the inaugural Ovation Awards, only apps from the U.S. app stores were selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public voting - Held from Nov 12th - Dec 14th, app users were able to vote for one or 20 apps (one per category, per OS) from our pool of 200 finalists. This data was then given to the panel of judges for final consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Judges weighed in - Our judges then interpreted the data between December 14th and January 9th to determine the winners for each OS and category, as well as the “Standing Ovation” winners, which were selected from the list of category winners. The panel of judges included accomplished mobile engineers, VCs, journalists, CEOs and others who understand apps inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;CATEGORY WINNERS FOR THE 2014 OVATION AWARD WINNERS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games&lt;/strong&gt; iOS Winner: Candy Crush Saga Android Winner: Temple Run 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*indicates app is also grand-prize, “Standing Ovation” winner and App of the Year for the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today launched its fourth major app quality offering – Mobile Beta Management. The new offering continues the company’s holistic view of app quality from the end user’s point-of-view, while breaking new ground for scale, scope and agility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mobile beta tools typically constrain the number of beta users or level of engagement, Applause’s Mobile Beta Management removes these limitations and enables companies to distill signal from noise to capture more actionable intelligence. The Applause Mobile Beta Management product further distinguishes itself by supporting global, enterprise-grade mobile beta programs with as many as hundreds of thousands of testers in a mobile-first framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In today’s apps economy, companies need to gather user feedback before they launch,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause Co-Founder and VP of Product, Roy Solomon.&lt;/strong&gt; “These app publishers need to be sure their apps satisfy user needs. For beta programs, that means high engagement rates and comprehensive feedback that help determine whether an app is ready for launch. With Applause Mobile Beta Management, we’ve made that level of confidence accessible to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key features of Applause’s Mobile Beta Management include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mobile-first workflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-the-Air Distribution –&lt;/strong&gt; users can download with a single tap&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile NDA Management –&lt;/strong&gt; enabling companies to protect IP and distribute quickly to users&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Session &amp; Crash Reporting –&lt;/strong&gt; providing insights into usage and app stability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-App Feedback Reporting –&lt;/strong&gt; streamlining the entire beta experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to solicit feedback from hundreds, thousands or hundreds of thousands of your employees or early adopter users quickly and easily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our Mobile Beta Management offering further establishes Applause as the one-stop shop for brands who want to maximize mobile app quality – from in-the-wild testing to full-scale beta management to user sentiment analysis in production,” added Applause Chief Strategy Officer Matt Johnston. “We are simplifying mobile beta programs for companies – no more spreadsheets, no more feedback on outdated builds, no more getting buried in unintelligible noise. This is about enabling brands to delight users and launch great apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients of Applause can access their management of all four of the company’s offerings through a 360° App Quality™ dashboard. The dashboard ties app quality data together, providing an integrated view of app quality, from development, through testing, to post-launch analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of Mobile Beta Management is the latest news in what has been a busy year for Applause. In January, the company announced it received a $43MM E-Round, led by Goldman Sachs. In May, Applause announced an expanded app quality offering and rebranded from uTest to Applause, and also made its entry into the EU with a major acquisition of top EU crowdtesting company, testhub (which became Applause EU). Just last month, Applause launched ARC - a free publication dedicated to providing expert analysis, information and research on every aspect of today’s apps economy - and the Ovation Awards, which celebrate the amount of applause winning apps receive from the public and experts.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Launches Enterprise-Grade Mobile Beta Management Offering` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;The Ovation Awards, the only app awards to measure what brands &amp; developers truly seek: the love and loyalty of users and experts - officially launched today with a call for public voting and a roster of expert judges from across the apps economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s connected world, users decide which apps receive standing ovations and which ones receive a smattering of applause (or even bring out the boo birds). Created by Applause to celebrate app quality as defined by the people who matter most - the ones who live, breathe and, most importantly, use apps, the Ovation Awards will unfold in three stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public voting: Nov 12 - Dec 14 -&lt;/strong&gt; Vote for your favorite apps - vote for just one, or vote for 20 (one per category per OS) from our pool of 200 finalists. This is a big part of what our panel of expert judges will consider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Judges weigh in -&lt;/strong&gt; Our panel includes accomplished mobile engineers, VCs, journalists, CEOs and others who understand apps inside and out. The decision of the judges will be final.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winners to be announced January 14, 2015 -&lt;/strong&gt; The winner for each category + OS will be announced, as will the grand-prize, overall winners for iOS and for Android.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;Categories and Operating Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners in both iOS and Android will be decided across 10 categories: Business/Finance &amp; Productivity; News/Info. &amp; Books; Education; Entertainment &amp; Fun; Games; Health &amp; Wellness; Retail &amp; Lifestyle; Music &amp; Multimedia; Sports; and Travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;Prizes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 200 finalists, the 20 category winners and the two grand prize winners will all receive fantastic prizes that acknowledge the current and continued quality of their app. Prizes include $5,000 in cash and $25,000 in free app quality services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;Determining the Finalists&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accurately measure user sentiment in order to narrow down millions of apps to a field of 200 finalists, a team of Applause analysts and data scientists utilized our mountain of data that fuels Applause Analytics (number of reviews, Applause score to measure user sentiment, et al). The team combined this data with additional data sources to gauge each app’s popularity and impact on the apps ecosystem to come up with a proprietary algorithm that determined the field of finalists. For the inaugural Ovation Awards, only apps from the U.S. app store were selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;Judges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges for the Ovation Awards include Futurist Robert Scoble, WayMedia’s Herminone Way, LeWeb Co-Founder Geraldine LeMeur and experts, entrepreneurs and tech luminaries from across the apps economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, today launched ARC, the Application Resource Center, a free publication dedicated to providing expert analysis, information and research on every aspect of today’s apps economy. ARC’s launch includes the release of two reports from its research arm, ARC 360. The reports take a deep look at the current state of mobile application quality in the retail and travel industries, including a ranking of which brands are leading in these ultra-competitive verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARC is a digital magazine about the apps economy, from the apps economy. It is led by former ReadWrite Mobile Editor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_rowinski&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Dan Rowinski&lt;/a&gt;, who joined Applause mid-2014 as Editor-in-Chief. Dan brings 10+ years of expertise covering tech trends and breaking news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The natural inclination is to typecast ARC as something familiar – content marketing, inbound marketing, branded journalism, native advertising-but in fact, this is something starkly different,” said Rowinski. “ARC is a publication for all things related to success in the apps economy – from design to development to testing, and from native to browser-based applications. We want to take this expertise and deep analysis, and make it freely available to stakeholders across the application lifecycle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, ARC is intended to be a resource. ARC will provide analysis, opinion, trends and research for those with a stake in the apps economy, be it app publishers, developers, QA professionals, or brand and business leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That data-based research will come from a specific arm of ARC - the research arm, known as ARC 360. Initially, ARC 360 will produce reports focused on benchmarking the state of app quality from across industries in the apps economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARC 360 reports were also released today and are focused on retail and travel industries. Ben Gray, former Principal Analyst at Forrester now on staff at Applause, authored the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reports cover 74 retail and 31 travel brands, including Amazon, eBay, Starbucks, Walmart, TripAdvisor, Hertz, Delta and United Airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the research reports provide a more focused, deeper look at specific industries as a whole, ARC takes a unique approach to online publishing. The features of ARC include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-depth Trends and Reporting -&lt;/strong&gt; Regularly-published series that focus on topics from across the apps economy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educational Indexing -&lt;/strong&gt; “Flash Cards” that educate around specific topics, providing critical information at-a-glance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ARC Reactor -&lt;/strong&gt; A running stream of data, factoids and quotes, aggregated from Applause and others sources around the web&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily News -&lt;/strong&gt; The vital, breaking information that people in the apps economy need to know&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ARC is an entirely new approach – and something no company has yet attempted: to produce expert content that is both independent and original, strictly for the sake of educating readers, and with no marketing angle” added &lt;strong&gt;Applause Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Matt Johnston.&lt;/strong&gt; “We’re excited to have both Dan and Ben on the Applause team, doing what they do best - analyzing, researching and telling the stories that matter about the apps economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARC will not contain news or announcements related to Applause operations. The company’s blog has been repurposed to share company-related news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARC is the latest news in what has been a busy year for Applause. In January, the company announced it received a $43MM E-Round, led by Goldman Sachs . In May, Applause announced an expanded app quality offering and rebranded from uTest to Applause, and also made its entry into the EU with a major acquisition of top EU crowdtesting company, testhub (which became Applause EU). The company expanded its footprint in other ways as well this year - through a global reseller partner program as well as partnerships and collaborations with IBM, Crittercism and Intel .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also added to its collection of accolades in 2014. In September, the company won an American Business Award for “Most Innovative Tech Company - up to 2500 employees” Earlier in 2014, the company was named the “#7th most promising company in America” by Forbes Magazine. The company also was named to its third consecutive top-1000 placing in the Inc. 5000 list in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;About ARC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARC believes the world is changing and that app developers, companies and users need a resource to help them navigate the immense opportunities and challenges of this app-driven world. There is nowhere that software and apps won’t eventually touch, and ARC will bring data to the enterprise, resources to developers, news and analysis to the enthusiast.

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the 360° app quality company&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it has partnered with Crittercism, the leader in mobile App Performance Management (mAPM). The joint initiative combines Applause’s mobile app testing services &amp; tools with Crittercism’s comprehensive suite of app performance management solutions to drive mobile growth for businesses. Through this partnership, Applause and Crittercism customers can now manage the pre- and post-development performance of their mobile apps more effectively to ensure optimal quality and time-to-market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In today’s app economy, where switching costs have decreased to virtually zero, it’s more important than ever for companies to provide winning digital experiences that work flawlessly in the hands of users,” said Applause CEO, Doron Reuveni. “The combination of Crittercism’s mAPM tools and Applause’s mobile testing services and tools will provide the ‘outside-in’ approach to improving app quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ultra-competitive industries such as retail, media, travel, health and financial services, mobile apps are among the top drivers of top-line revenue growth.

Applause provides companies with access to in-the-wild mobile app testing services so they can identify and fix issues before their app goes to the app stores. Once the app is live, companies can leverage Crittercism’s best-in-class app performance management solution to gain visibility into their app’s performance, enabling enterprises to detect production problems and determine their business impact. By implementing robust testing and real-time performance monitoring, Applause and Crittercism helps enterprises deliver higher-quality apps and accelerate their mobile growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The need for app performance management and testing solutions to ensure quality app delivery and speedy time-to-market is growing exponentially,” said Andrew Levy, co-founder and CEO of Crittercism. “Our partnership with Applause highlights our joint commitment to helping our customers maximize the performance of their apps, reduce development release cycles and accelerate mobile growth.”&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Teams Up With Crittercism to Improve Mobile App Quality` ...</div>

Through this teaming, the two firms have co-developed mobile app quality solutions that enable companies to improve app quality and delight their mobile users. These offerings take the form of both on-premise and cloud-based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause worked closely with IBM’s MobileFirst and Rational Software technology teams to develop solutions that help companies better achieve mobile app quality that aligns with users’ perspectives. Applause and IBM will also work together on thought leadership activities to advance the market’s knowledge around the value of user-centric app quality across the software development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past year, we’ve discovered that IBM and Applause share a worldview about the growing criticality of application quality,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CEO, Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “In the apps economy, users decide which apps, brands and businesses win, and which ones lose. Working with IBM to advance the market’s understanding of 360° mobile app quality will help companies launch better mobile experiences and beat their competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM and Applause will also collaborate on co-marketing efforts - hosting events, exhibiting at conferences and referring customers to one another for additional services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In today’s apps economy it’s more important than ever to be certain that applications work as intended in the hands of users,” said &lt;strong&gt;Leigh Williams, IBM Distinguished Engineer, Rational Mobile Software Development Strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; “User-centric mobile app quality is a key differentiator. Companies - from hot startups to global leaders - need to understand app quality signals at every stage of the application lifecycle. This will enable them to make better decisions about when to launch and what to create next. We look forward to continuing our relationship with Applause on mobile quality solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2008 as uTest, Applause recently re-launched under its current name with an expanded app quality vision - one that includes integrated app quality tools and services. That same day, the company announced its formal entry into the EU market by acquiring German crowdtesting leader, Testhub, which is now known as Applause EU. In January, the company closed a $43MM Series E Round of funding, led by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applause, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;the global leader in testing, feedback and research for digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;, in-the-wild testing pioneer uTest re-launched with an expanded vision today as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;Applause&lt;/a&gt;, the 360° app quality company. The company also announced its entry into the global market by acquiring top German crowdtesting company, Testhub, which will become the European headquarters for Applause operations. The multi-million dollar deal consists of a combination of cash and equity and, as part of the acquisition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.berlinholding.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Berlin Technologie Holding (BTH)&lt;/a&gt; becomes a strategic investor in Applause EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause brings together the tightly integrated app quality solutions companies need to earn and measure the loyalty of their users, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In-the-wild testing services - real-world testing for web, desktop and mobile apps across the entire product lifecycle, includingfunctional, usability, load and localization testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobile SDK - free tool that enables build distribution, crash &amp; bug reporting, and user feedback on iOS, Android and Windows Phone apps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobile analytics - advanced analytics from all the major app stores so companies can listen more effectively to user feedback and sentiment about app quality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;360° app quality dashboard - ties app quality data together, providing technology leaders with an integrated view of app quality, from pre-launch to post-launch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these offerings are completely modular, meaning companies can purchase just what they need and expand their solutions as their needs grow. The company had previously announced it would be expanding its vision and changing its name from uTest to Applause. With today’s re-launch, the move to help companies focus more holistically on app quality is now realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;” Web, mobile and wearable applications - and the quality of these digital experiences - are the gateway to brands and businesses. This new ideal of 360° app quality is the best way for companies to differentiate themselves, and win in the highly competitive apps economy,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause CEO Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; And modern app quality is no longer just a developer or QA problem; it’s a CIO problem, a marketing problem, a sales problem and a CEO problem. As Applause, we bring together a range for testing services and app quality tools to enable companies to achieve this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Organizations need to constantly gather user feedback and feed that data back into their application lifecycle to continuously enhance quality,” said Peter Marston from research firm, IDC. “Given the importance of quality, this practice of application quality management (AQM) will need specific, efficiently dedicated resources from companies if they wish to stay ahead of competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since launching as uTest in 2008, Applause has achieved many milestones, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raising funding of $80MM - including a $43MM E Round, led by Goldman Sachs in January 2014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Winning awards for innovation and growth from expert sources like Gartner,Forbes, and Inc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing to 160 employees in North America and Europe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing its company footprint from its Boston headquarters to locations in San Francisco, New York City and Seattle, as well as the new Applause EU headquarters in Berlin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing 4-year revenues by more than 4,000%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The re-launch comes the same day that Applause announced its acquisition of Testhub. In the next month, Testhub will transition to Applause EU and make additional hires in several key markets. Then the team will begin marketing, selling and delivering the Applause app quality offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re very proud of what Testhub has achieved, and joining forces with uTest - now Applause - is a great scenario and a phenomenal opportunity to combine global reach with European expertise” said &lt;strong&gt;Testhub CEO, Jan Wolter.&lt;/strong&gt; “We believe in building long-term relationships with our customers to help them launch consistently high-quality apps. That’s what we’ve done as Testhub and what we will do even better as Applause EU.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to acquire Testhub came after several months of discussions, and only after all the EU crowdtesting players had been researched and evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Testhub stood out because they were building the right way - by focusing on their customers and employees. They’re closely aligned with the values and philosophy that we held in building uTest, and carry forward into Applause,” said &lt;strong&gt;Applause Chief Marketing &amp; Strategy Officer, Matt Johnston.&lt;/strong&gt; “The Testhub team truly understands the European market - including localization, fragmentation and data security - and this move demonstrates our commitment to delivering robust, secure, world-class service to European customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being an investor in Applause EU, Berlin Technologie Holding will serve as an advisor and facilitator, connecting the company with local market expertise and future customer demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Testhub is the first crowdtesting startup to successfully exit - and it’s joining the company that created the entire crowdtesting category,” added &lt;strong&gt;BTH Managing Partner, Joern-Carlos Kuntze.&lt;/strong&gt; “This sends a clear message to the EU market about Testhub’s success, and positions Applause as the clear leader in the global crowdtesting space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining their track record with Testhub’s, Applause is the largest, most mature crowdtesting player in the EU. This provides European customers with an unmatched breadth and reliability of testing solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7+ years combined in the market -&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly 3X longer than any other crowdtesting players&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;140,000+ testers from 200 countries &amp; territories -&lt;/strong&gt; More testers and locations covered than all other players combined&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,000,000+ test reports -&lt;/strong&gt; More than 4X the combined total of the other players&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50K+ test cycles -&lt;/strong&gt; 4X more than all the other players combined&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only crowdtesting firm with thousands of customers -&lt;/strong&gt; Including Google, Amazon, USA Today, Netflix, Box and Runkeeper&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only crowdtesting firm that pays out millions of dollar to its tester community each quarter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also announced the launch of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;uTest&lt;/a&gt;, which moves from the customer-facing brand to a community hub for all things related to professional testers and software testing.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `uTest Changes Name To Applause; Announces Acquisition Of Leading EU Crowdtesting Firm, Testhub, In Multi-Million Dollar Deal` ...</div>

<div class='progress-msg'>[22:41:51] - Custom field `_et_pb_old_content` will be updated with value `Fast-Growing App Quality Company Makes Top Ten on Forbes’ List for 2nd Consecutive Year; Ranking Comes Ahead of Company Name Change to Applause, Follows Last Week’s $43MM E Round.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;uTest&lt;/a&gt;, the leading provider of in-the-wild software testing, has been listed at No. 7 on Forbes’ third annual ranking of America’s Most Promising Companies – a list of one hundred privately held, high-growth companies with bright futures. The ranking marks the 2nd consecutive year the company has made the Forbes list’s top ten, coming in at No. 8 last year. The list is featured in the February 10th print issue of Forbes and the full list of companies is available online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forbes ’ third annual list of America’s Most Promising Companies recognizes 100 privately-held, high-growth companies. Companies that made the cut boast compelling business models, strong management teams, as well as notable customers and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forbes strove for a holistic gauge of young, privately-held businesses, attempting to pin down their trajectories by taking a range of variables into account. Over the course of four months Forbes reviewed hundreds of applications. The final assessment is based on growth (both in sales and hiring), quality of management teams and investors, margins, market size and key partnerships. After verifying sales numbers, speaking with each company and debating their merits and blemishes, Forbesproduces a final ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headquartered near Boston, uTest has seen consistent success and sharp growth since launching in August of 2008. The company has received over $80 MM in funding, including a recently-announced&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$43MM E-Round, led by Goldman Sachs. The company had previously announced that it will be expanding its app quality offerings and changing its name to Applause later in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recent milestones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establishing a presence in Silicon Valley, Seattle, New York, Los Angeles and Dallas – with resellers serving dozens of international markets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing more than 30,000 new builds for 2,000 companies of all sizes – including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, USA Today, Rolex, Box and Runkeeper&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing its global community of professional testers to more than 100,000&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The acquisition of mobile SDK, Apphance in 2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The launch of Applause Analytics in 2013&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numerous awards, including additional recent wins from theAmerican Business Awards,Gartner and Inc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being named as Forbes’ 7th Most Promising Company in America is an amazing honor. And to make their top ten in consecutive years is a great affirmation of the apps economy and uTest’s role in it” said &lt;strong&gt;uTest CEO, Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “Given the future growth of the apps economy – for phones, tablets, laptops, wearable devices and automobiles – it is critical that companies’ apps work flawlessly in the hands of users. The fact that we enable customers to create apps that their users love positions us well for our future as Applause and for the steep growth that lies ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;` for post `uTest Named 7th Most Promising Company In America by Forbes Magazine` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;uTest&lt;/a&gt;, the in-the-wild app testing leader, today announced it has closed a $43 Million Series E round of funding, led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldmansachs.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;. The funding comes ahead of the company’s previously announced plans to expand its offering and change its name to Applause, and brings its funding-to-date to more than $80 Million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the company rolls out its expanded Applause vision in the coming months, it will use this funding to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand in-the-wild testing services.&lt;/strong&gt; The company will invest heavily in its real-world software testing services, including significant commitments to further advancing its functional, usability, security, load and localization testing solutions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring 360° app quality to brands around the world,&lt;/strong&gt; ushering in a new era of App Quality Management. Applause will include a suite of tools and analytics related to holistic app quality. This combined solution will enable a company’s stakeholders – including developers, QA, product, marketers and CEOs – to better understand users’ wants and experiences, and to use that information to create apps that win.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grow distribution channels.&lt;/strong&gt; The company is deep in talks with strategic partners to bring 360⁰ app quality into the offerings of the application lifecycle management (ALM) leaders. International expansion is planned through a recently announced reseller program – particularly in the EU and Asia-Pacific markets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broaden uTest.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the larger Applause offering, the company will leverage the uTest brand as an open community that caters to testers and advances the profession of software testing. The uTest offering will expand beyond paid projects to include training, certifications, test tool reviews, career advice, job boards and events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In-the-wild testing has become a critical part of launching great digital experiences – from apps for web, mobile, wearables and beyond. Funding on this scale, and from a leader like Goldman Sachs, will help us broaden these services, and incorporate tools that enable companies to achieve 360° app quality,” said &lt;strong&gt;uTest CEO, Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “We’re positioned for a massive market opportunity, and to extend our lead as the one-stop solution for modern app quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The round had full participation from all of uTest’s previous investors, including QuestMark Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Longworth Venture Partners, Mass Ventures, Egan-Managed Capital and Mesco Ltd. The company’s previous round of funding was a $17 Million Series D round in December 2011. As part of the Series E investment, &lt;strong&gt;David Campbell, Goldman Sachs’ Managing Director, Merchant Banking Division&lt;/strong&gt; will join the uTest Board of Directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, customer-facing applications have become critically important for most businesses. And app quality is a key differentiator between winners and losers in this era of the always-connected, on-the-go, highly vocal user,” added Campbell. “When you consider the complexity of creating truly great applications, uTest is uniquely positioned to help its customers win, and to build a large, lasting company in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s news comes as companies are recognizing the full importance of App Quality Management. And as the apps economy grows ever-faster, these digital experiences have become the front door to brands, to the companies behind them, and to their top-line results. At the same time, the rise in social media and app store reviews has given users a larger voice than ever before. These user signals now play a significant role in defining app quality and are increasingly utilized by companies. &lt;strong&gt;Research firm IDC’s Peter Marston&lt;/strong&gt; stated the value of these signals in 2013:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Use of outside signals in application life-cycle development is an effective, increasingly holistic way to gather a fuller spectrum of data that help application vendors, in turn, be more strategic in how they build or enhance their applications, as well as help foster stronger user adoption upon an application’s release.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headquartered near Boston, uTest has seen consistent success and sharp growth since launching in August of 2008. Company milestones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establishing a presence in Silicon Valley, Seattle, New York, Los Angeles and Dallas – with resellers serving dozens of international markets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing more than 30,000 new builds for 2,000 companies of all sizes – including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, USA Today, Rolex, Box and Runkeeper&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growing its global community of professional testers to more than 100,000&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The acquisition of mobile SDK, Apphance in 2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The launch of Applause Analytics in 2013&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numerous awards, including recent wins from the American Business Awards, Gartner, Forbes and Inc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;` for post `uTest Closes $43 Million Series E Round Led By Goldman Sachs` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;uTest&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading provider of in-the-wild software and app testing solutions, has hired Chris Malone as its new Chief Financial Officer. In his new role, Chris will oversee all of uTest’s financial and administrative operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A veteran of the IT Services industry, he previously served as the Vice President of Finance for NTT DATA (previously Keane), the 6th largest Global IT service provider. At NTT DATA, Chris held leadership roles that included oversight of the financial management of the Company’s U.S. and Canada Commercial Operations. Prior to NTT DATA, he was Managing Director at Corporate Finance Group where he leveraged his technical skills to advise corporate executives on financial management, M&amp;A transactions and public offerings. Chris is a Certified Public Accountant and holds both a Masters of Business Administration and a B.S. from Babson College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re very excited to have an executive of Chris’ caliber join the team,” said &lt;strong&gt;uTest CEO Doron Reuveni.&lt;/strong&gt; “uTest has expanded greatly in the past year – in terms of our headcount, vision, offering &amp; top line. Adding Chris to the team readies us for our next chapter of helping companies launch high-quality apps that their users love.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiring is the latest in what has been a year filled with accolades and accomplishments for the app quality company. In September, the company won an American Business Award for “Fastest Growing Tech Company ” and was also named “Private Company of the Year ” by the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council. Earlier in 2013, the company was named the “ #8th most promising company in America ” by Forbes, “the #1 Pacesetter in the Boston area ” by the Boston Business Journal , and “number four” on Bostinno.com’s list of “ 50 Boston-area companies and individuals that are on fire .” The company also was named to its second consecutive Inc. 500 list last month, and its in-the-wild app testing services recently placed 2nd for “Enterprise Mobile Solution” at the Mobile Merit Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;uTest’s app analytics tool, Applause, has also garnered significant recognition since launching in January. In September, the tool garnered 2nd place for “Tech Innovation of the Year” at the American Business Awards . Earlier in the year, Applause was also named “ Most Insightful Big Data and Analytics Innovation ” by MITX and also placed 3rd at both CTIA’s Emerging Technology Awards and the Global Mobile Awards. Applause was also been named a “Cool Vendor in Mobile Marketing, 2013” by Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, as it celebrated its 5th anniversary, the company’s global community of professional testers reached the 100,000 mark. Just last month, the company revealed in an interview with Forbes Magazine that, in 2014, it will be expanding its vision and taking the name of its current analytics product, Applause .

&lt;p&gt;Applause, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.applause.com&quot;&gt;mobile app analytics service&lt;/a&gt; that uses more than 60 million reviews to score 1 million iOS and Android apps, today announced the launch of the Applause Index. This index offers the first-ever way to measure and monitor the state of user satisfaction in the mobile apps economy. The index provides a daily look at how users feel about bellwether iOS and Android apps and assigns a weighted, cumulative index score similar to those used to measure the overall stock market. This enables journalists, analysts and company leaders to understand trends in the macro apps economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause Index also includes a full complement of sub-indices that measure specific categories of market-representative apps across ten categories, including Gaming; Lifestyle; Entertainment, Travel and Content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause Index is calculated based upon the Applause Score of 60 iOS and 60 Android apps that meet specific selection criteria. It then applies a weighted formula to produce a daily cumulative score across the selected apps. The result is a top-down, representative look at what users think about the apps economy across categories of apps; across app stores; and over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The apps economy is driven by how effectively companies connect with users. Through app store ratings and social media, those users decide which apps and companies win or lose,” said uTest Labs’ Matt Johnston. “The Applause Index fills a need we’ve heard expressed – from business leaders, from journalists, and from top-tier analysts – seeking a way to accurately track and measure overall user sentiment and satisfaction in the apps economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;SELECTING APPS FOR THE APPLAUSE INDEX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection process for the Applause Index was data-driven and rigorous. The data scientists who helped create Applause did extensive research into how financial indices were built, weighted and reported, and the Applause Index was created using the same process and premises. After extensive modeling, specific criteria were selected, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of app versions and app reviews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Length of time an app has been available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance data across Applause Attributes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Representative allocation across sub-index categories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;100% overlap between the list of the top 60 iOS and top 60 Android apps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The early adoption for Applause has exceeded our wildest expectations. It has quickly become an essential part of how brand and technical leaders measure their app success,” added Johnston. “But one of the common refrains we’ve heard from early users and those who cover the apps economy is for a way to measure the ups and downs of the overarching app market. The Applause Index solves this problem in a way that no other data source can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;SCORING THE APPLAUSE INDEX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To come up with the overall Index scores for iOS and Android, as well as the scores of the sub-indices, the Applause team once again applied deep mathematics to ensure the result was more than just the total of the selected apps’ Applause Scores. The selected apps were subjected to a complex weighting process similar to those of popular stock market indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;THE SUB-INDICES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Apple and Google Play app stores use different category structures, the Applause Index maps similar apps and categories to create 10 sub-indices. Each of these is comprised of 15 iOS and 15 Android apps. The Applause category-specific indices are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business &amp; Productivity&lt;/strong&gt; (business, finance, utilities, tools)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content, News &amp; Books&lt;/strong&gt; (news, content, books, reference)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education&lt;/strong&gt; (education tools and classes, science)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entertainment&lt;/strong&gt; (TV, casual, movies, entertainment-themed)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games&lt;/strong&gt; (games, sports games, arcade &amp; action)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health&lt;/strong&gt; (health, health &amp; fitness)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt; (shopping, social, food &amp; drink)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music &amp; Multimedia&lt;/strong&gt; (music, video and photo tools)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sports&lt;/strong&gt; (major sports leagues and sports news)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt; (travel, transportation, locale-specific resources)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;title as-h3&quot;&gt;MOVING FORWARD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applause Index and sub-indices will be updated daily, and the list of apps will be formally reviewed each quarter – with some apps being added or removed, depending upon market trends. Further, the company will issue free Applause Index research reports on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Applause Index marks a new day for the apps economy,” added uTest CEO Doron Reuveni. “Apps are everywhere and touch nearly every aspect of our lives. Now there is a tool, based on rigorous math and supported by a dedicated team, which enables analysis of how users perceive and impact that economy as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;` for post `Applause Launches Applause Index to Measure the State of the Apps Economy` ...</div>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;uTest&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s leading provider of in-the-wild software testing services, today announced it has acquired mobile app quality tools company, Apphance, from its parent company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polidea.com/&quot;&gt;Polidea&lt;/a&gt;, in a seven-figure deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uTest acquires all intellectual property related to Apphance as well as engineering talent that will maintain, extend and build new functionality into what will go to market as uTest Apphance, a tool that will complement uTest’s in-the-wild testing services for mobile apps. In return, Polidea receives cash and equity in uTest. This is the first acquisition activity for either firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This acquisition is a giant step forward in the growth of uTest,” said &lt;strong&gt;Doron Reuveni, CEO of uTest.&lt;/strong&gt; “By adding Apphance to our in-the-wild testing services, we’ve dramatically increased our value to customers and extended our position as an all-in-one testing solution for mobile developers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roots of the deal can be traced back to 2011, when the two firms first crossed paths at Mobile App World in London. As uTest’s mobile app testing business grew dramatically – 5X in the past 12 months – and the Apphance tool continued to mature, discussions between the two parties evolved, ultimately leading to today’s announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apphance was built based on the needs we identified while working on various mobile apps for customers,” added &lt;strong&gt;Polidea’s CEO, Jakub Lipiński.&lt;/strong&gt; “We’re very excited to expand the reach and distribution of this technology. With uTest’s impressive footprint, developers and testers from around the world will now be able to utilize this tool, further ensuring that mobile apps work as designed in the hands of end users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of brands – including Google, USA Today, Amazon, Virgin, Sony, Box and Trulia – have already adopted uTest to meet the real-world testing needs of their web and mobile apps. With more than 60,000 professional testers in 190 countries, uTest enables companies to test their apps under real-world conditions across OS, browsers, carriers, devices, locations and other criteria. The combination of uTest and Apphance will make it simple to distribute new versions of apps to this community of professional testers, enabling mobile developers to see how their apps work on actual mobile devices across carriers and locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uTest Apphance provides an easy-to-use web platform for developers to view crashes, bugs and user feedback. After signing up, a developer adds Apphance code to their mobile app, enabling any device running their app in pre-production or production to integrate with Apphance. This enables developers and testers to see highly detailed diagnostics of each bug or crash, helping them identify the root cause and launch higher quality apps. To showcase the power of Apphance, uTest will be making it available to all developers free of charge for the duration of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uTest Apphance’s features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-the-Air Build Distribution -&lt;/strong&gt; Developers can distribute new builds over-the-air to real devices for testing purposes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crash Reporting -&lt;/strong&gt; Automated, real-time crash reports are filtered by OS version, device and other parameters; available for pre- and post-launch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-App Bug Reporting -&lt;/strong&gt; Bug reports can be submitted directly from the app; available for pre- and post-launch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-App User Feedback -&lt;/strong&gt; User feedback can be submitted directly from the app, enabling developers to easily spot trends, discover issues and receive new ideas from end users&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uTest Apphance currently supports all the leading app platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone 7, Kindle Fire and Barnes &amp; Noble’s Nook. Support for HTML5 is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“uTest Apphance fills a critical need in the mobile app development ecosystem,” said &lt;strong&gt;Nolan Wright, CTO and co-founder of Appcelerator,&lt;/strong&gt; the leading mobile platform with over 350,000 mobile developers. “Apphance enables a closed loop of communication between developers, testers and users. Coupled with uTest’s endless community of testers, uTest Apphance is an invaluable resource for mobile developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;title is-4&quot;&gt;About uTest Apphance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uTest Apphance enables mobile developers to know precisely how their apps are working in the test lab and in the wild. A single library enables over-the-air app distribution, as well as crash reports, in-app bug reports and user feedback. Now developers know precisely what’s working – and not – with their iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Kindle Fire and Nook apps, in both pre-production and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when combined with uTest’s in-the-wild testing services, companies can distribute their apps to 60,000+ professional testers from 190 countries around the world. Thousands of companies – from early startups to global enterprises – rely on uTest to put mobile applications through their paces by testing on real devices under real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;` for post `uTest Acquires Mobile App Tool Company, Apphance, In Seven-Figure Deal` ...</div>
